  -static           do not do any dynamic linking of libtool libraries
  -version-info CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]

treated as uninstalled libtool libraries, other files are standard or library
object files.\n

only library objects (`.lo' files) may be specified, and `-rpath' is
required, except when creating a convenience library.\n
If OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.a' or `.lib', then a standard library is created
using `ar' and `ranlib', or on Windows using `lib'.\n
If OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.lo' or `.${objext}', then a reloadable object file
is created, otherwise an executable program is created.\n";
