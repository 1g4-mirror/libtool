This is an alpha testing release of GNU libtool.

Please do not send any bug reports or questions about it to public
forums (such as GNU newsgroups and mailing lists), send them directly
to Gordon Matzigkeit <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

There are several references to a future release of Automake in
libtool, that may not work with your own copy of Automake.  Gordon is
working closely with Tom Tromey to integrate libtool patches into
Automake.

In the meantime, just ignore these references, or use Gord's
modified version of automake-1.1i that supports all the features
described in the libtool manual:
