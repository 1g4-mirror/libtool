* Sanity check to detect broken collect2 on AIX:

checking if libraries in .libs can be linked... no
configure: error: basic sanity check failed; look at config.log
If you are using GCC versions before 2.8 on AIX, try configuring with
the native C compiler instead (set the CC environment variable to `xlc').

mkdir .libs
echo > conftest.c
$CC -c conftest.c
$AR cru .libs/libct.a conftest.o
$RANLIB .libs/libct.a # if necessary
echo 'int main () { return 0; }' > conftest.c
$CC -c conftest.c
$CC -o conftest conftest.o .libs/libct.a

* Document convenience libraries, -whole-archive, and
-no-whole-archive.

* Document the -export-dynamic flag, and the new dlname mode.

For 1.1:

* We also need a way to use convenience libraries just to resolve
symbols, rather than the (simplistic) whole-archive and
no-whole-archive.

* Write libtool not to be dependent on the compiler used to configure
it.

* Implement full multi-language support.  There are beginnings of this
in the manual (Other Languages).

Sometime in the future (maybe):

* Implement `-static' linking against installed libraries, even when
the OS does not have static system libraries.  This would need to be
done by parsing `-L' and `-l', searching for libNAME.a manually, and
adding the full path to it.

* Implement full support for other basic library types (libhello_g,
libhello_p).  Make these types configurable.  Some thinking will have
to be done about the defaults, and what libhello (standard type)
should be.

Maybe we should just add an autoconf macro and get creative with
program_transform_name, or something.  These changes should be
partially driven by the needs of packaging tools, such as RPM and
dpkg.

* Add support for windoze DLL's.  Check out Lesstif and Tcl
configuration again.  The Cygnus win32 project may also be of value.
