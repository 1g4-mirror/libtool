For 1.0:

* Give some hints for languages other than C, such as C++, Fortran,
and preprocessed assembler.  There are beginnings of this in the
manual (Other Languages).

* Finish documenting shared library systems.  Ugh.  I'll need more
primary documentation in order to do this well.

Sometime in the future (maybe):

* Implement full support for other basic library types (libhello_g,
libhello_p).  Make these types configurable.  Some thinking will have
to be done about the defaults, and what libhello (standard type)
should be.

Unfortunately, if we do this, we're back to the pre-0.6
one-directory-per-object type.  Maybe we should just add an autoconf
macro and get creative with program_transform_name, or something.

* Add support for windoze DLL's, and maybe old Linux jumptable
libraries.  Check out Lesstif and Tcl configuration again.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?
Probably nothing.

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  See if it is really
true of any other processors: at least powerpc, powerpcle.

* Maybe choosing between ln -s and cp -p should be done in ltconfig,
not ltmain.sh?  Maybe we should avoid it entirely, and just create
timestamp .lo files, with the PIC objects in .libs/*.o.
