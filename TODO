* Find link_static_flag for every C compiler, (don't forget native
cc's for HP-UX and OSF/1).

* Implement fuller support for profiled libraries (libNAME_p), and
resolve naming difficulties for debuggable libraries (libNAME_g on
Linux at least), old system 5 shared libraries (libNAME_s), etc.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  See if it is true of
any other processors (like maybe powerpc).
