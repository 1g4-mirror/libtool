* Implement `ld -r' on all platforms.

* Don't forget to find link_static_flag for native cc's on HP-UX and OSF/1.

* Write installcheck for the demo directory.

* Implement fuller support for profiled libraries (libNAME_p), and
resolve naming difficulties for debuggable libraries (libNAME_g on
Linux at least), old system 5 shared libraries (libNAME_s), etc, maybe
based on cflags.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  See if it is true of
any other processors (like maybe powerpc).

* Maybe choosing between ln -s and cp -p should be done in ltconfig,
not ltmain.sh?
