For 1.0:

* Finish documenting shared library systems.  Ugh.  I'll need more
primary documentation in order to do this well.

For 1.1:

* Write libtool not to be dependent on the compiler used to configure
it.

* Implement full multi-language support.  There are beginnings of this
in the manual (Other Languages).

Sometime in the future (maybe):

* Implement `-static' linking against installed libraries, even when
the OS does not have static system libraries.  This would need to be
done by parsing `-L' and `-l', searching for libNAME.a manually, and
adding the full path to it.

* Implement full support for other basic library types (libhello_g,
libhello_p).  Make these types configurable.  Some thinking will have
to be done about the defaults, and what libhello (standard type)
should be.

Maybe we should just add an autoconf macro and get creative with
program_transform_name, or something.  These changes should be
partially driven by the needs of packaging tools, such as RPM and
dpkg.

* Add support for windoze DLL's.  Check out Lesstif and Tcl
configuration again.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?
Probably nothing.

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  See if it is really
true of any other processors: at least powerpc, powerpcle.
