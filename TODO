* Find link_static_flag for every C compiler, currently at least
native cc's for AIX, HP-UX, OSF/1.

* Configure test for a library-stripping program (strip -x on NetBSD)

* Implement fuller support for profiled libraries (libNAME_p), and
resolve naming difficulties for debuggable libraries (libNAME_g on
Linux at least), old system 5 shared libraries (libNAME_s), etc.

* We should use the C compiler rather than the linker to create shared
libraries, if at all possible.  This just involves looking up the $wl
values for system compilers.

* What should be done about the difference between -fpic and -fPIC?

* GCC docs imply that all rs6000 code is PIC.  If that is true, then
implement it.
