Before 1.0:
***********

* Document inter-library dependencies, and write a flag to allow
undefined symbols (`-allow-undefined').  We'll need a special flag for
OSF/1 not to warn about this
(allow_undefined_flag='-expect_unresolved', inserted into
archive_cmds).

* The way we'll implement `-allow-undefined' is to have link mode
search for `${allow_undefined_flag}' in the archive_cmds.  If it finds
it, then either set allow_undefined_flag to empty, or leave it alone
(if -allow-undefined is specified).  If it does not exist (such as on
AIX), then create a static library instead.

* Document the -export-dynamic flag, and the new dlname mode.  These
should be discussed under a node called `Dynamic modules' or
something.

After 1.0:
**********

* A better check to detect broken collect2 on AIX, once the bug is
fixed in GCC.

* We could use libtool object convenience libraries that resolve
symbols to be included in a libtool archive.

* Finish up the dlname mode, and get it integrated with DLD.  We need
a way for different major versions of the same .la to coexist.  This
also involves writing a better uninstall mode, so that nothing
breaks.

* Implement full multi-language support.  Currently, this is only for
C++, but there are beginnings of this in the manual (Other Languages).
This includes writing libtool not to be so dependent on the compiler
used to configure it.

Things to think about:
**********************

* Implement full support for other orthogonal library types
(libhello_g, libhello_p).  Make these types configurable.  Some
thinking will have to be done about the defaults, and what libhello
(standard type) should be.

Maybe we should just add an autoconf macro and get creative with
library_transform_name, or something.  These changes should be
partially driven by the needs of packaging tools, such as RPM and
dpkg.

* Talk with RMS about his so-called `automatic package generation
tool.'  This is probably what Thomas has been murmuring about for the
Hurd.  We'll need to integrate package-supplied programs such as
libtool into that scheme, since it manages some of the preinstall and
postinstall commands, but isn't installed itself.  Probably, things
like libtool should be distributed as part of such a binary package.

* Add support for windoze DLL's, and maybe other jumptable libs.
Check out Lesstif and Tcl configuration again (maybe they would be
interested in libtool by now?).  The Cygnus win32 project may also be
of value, though it still seems pretty rudimentary right now.
