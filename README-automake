There are several references to a future release of Automake in
libtool, that may not work with your own copy of Automake.  Only
releases of Automake after automake-1.1m work with libtool as
documented in the manual.

You can find the latest Automake prerelease (warning: it is not
guaranteed to be completely stable) at:

<URL:ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey/>

Once Automake 1.2 is released, you should get it from your closest GNU
mirror.

Thanks,
