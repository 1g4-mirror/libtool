# It is okay for the bootstrap process to require unreleased autoconf
# or automake, as long as any released libtool will work with at least
# the newest stable versions of each.  Generally, newer versions offer
# better features, and configure.ac documents oldest version of each
# required for bootstrap (AC_PREREQ, and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE).

# Upgrade caveat:

WARNING: If bootstrapping with this script fails, it may be due to an
WARNING: incompatible installed `libtool.m4' being pulled in to
WARNING: `aclocal.m4'.  The best way to work around such a problem is to
WARNING: uninstall your system libtool files, or failing that, overwrite
WARNING: them with `libtool.m4' as shipped with this distribution.
WARNING: After that, retry this bootstrap.
