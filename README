This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
libraries) behind a consistent interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for
details.

Libtool supports building static libraries on all platforms.

Shared library support has been implemented for these platforms:
  NetBSD 1.x (*-*-netbsd*)

See the file NEWS for a description of recent changes to libtool.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install libtool.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, or you wish to port libtool
to a new platform, please send electronic mail to Gord Matzigkeit
<gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.
