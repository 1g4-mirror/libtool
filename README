This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
interface.

To use libtool, add the new generic library building commands to your
Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for
details.

Libtool supports building static libraries on all platforms.

Shared library support has been implemented for these platforms:
  AIX 3.x (*-*-aix3*)
  AIX 4.x (*-*-aix4*)
  Digital/UNIX 3.x, 4.x, a.k.a. OSF/1 (*-*-osf3*, *-*-osf4*)
  FreeBSD 2.x, 3.x (*-*-freebsd2*, *-*-freebsd3*)
  HP-UX 9.x, 10.x (*-*-hpux9*, *-*-hpux10*)
  IRIX 5.x, 6.x (*-*-irix5*, *-*-irix6*)
  Linux ELF (*-*-linux*, except aout, coff, and oldld)
  NetBSD 1.x (*-*-netbsd*)
  OpenBSD 2.x (*-*-openbsd*)
  OS/2 using EMX (*-*-os2*)
  SCO OpenServer 5.x (*-*-sco3.2v5*)
  Solaris 2.x (*-*-solaris2*)
  SunOS 4.x, a.k.a. Solaris 1.x  (*-*-sunos4*)
  UTS 4.x (*-*-uts4*)
  All ELF targets that use both the GNU C compiler (gcc) and GNU ld

See the file NEWS for a description of recent changes to libtool.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
libtool.

See the info node (libtool)Tested Platforms. (or the file
doc/platforms.texi) for a list of platforms that libtool shared
library support was tested on.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, or you wish to port
libtool to a new platform, please send electronic mail to the libtool
mailing list <bug-libtool@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  Don't forget to mention
the version of libtool that you are currently using (by typing
`ltconfig --version').
