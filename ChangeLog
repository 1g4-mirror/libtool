Fri Feb  6 00:20:41 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Use file(1) to discover which ABI we're using
 	on IRIX, and propagate the correct linker flag.  From Jim Wilson.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (Xsed): `arg=-n; echo "$arg" | sed ...'
  	gives problems, because the `-n' is interpreted as an option to
 	echo(1).  So, use `echo "X$arg" | sed -e 's/^X//' ...' everywhere,
	via the $Xsed convenience variable.  Suggested by H.J. Lu.

Mon Feb  2 12:24:22 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in: Turn off IRIX shared library support until 32-bit
	and 64-bit ABI differences can be resolved.

Wed Jan 28 14:33:04 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Reverse yesterday's change because `-old_ld'
	isn't accepted by GCC.

Tue Jan 27 09:59:19 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in (soname_spec): Add in user-specified release numbers
	for every host system that supports an soname that differs from
	the linkname.

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Add `-old_ld' to the list of flags that need to
	be passed through on SGI.  Reported by Chris Lee.

	* ltmain.in (release): Prepend a hyphen to the release number, and
 	fix a typo because `-version-info' takes only 3 args.  From
 	H.J. Lu.

Sun Jan 25 12:44:50 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in (library_names_spec): On Linux, use the
 	user-specified release.

	* ltmain.in (link): Allow the user to specify a release number for
 	the library using the `-release' flag.  Suggested by H.J. Lu and
 	Ian Lance Taylor.

Mon Jan 19 10:03:03 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in (old_postuninstall_cmds): Reorder so that chmod
	happens after ranlib.  From Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer.

	* ltmain.in (mode): Added `gcc*' and `*-gcc*' to the patterns that
	recognize compilers.  From Pieter Schoenmakers.
	(link): Recognize `.a' files again.  Suggested by Pieter
	Schoenmakers.

Sun Jan 18 15:16:34 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltmain.in (compile): Recognize `.asm' extension, for use with
	the nasm assembler.  From Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer.

Mon Jan 12 14:01:06 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in (runpath_var): Use instead of
	`hardcode_runpath_var'.

Sun Jan 11 11:55:32 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltmain.in (finish): Add a better --finish message.  Suggested by
	Kenneth Albanowski.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in: Fix a few typos.

Sat Jan  3 10:03:41 1998  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltmain.in (link): Quote the definition of $echo in the wrapper
	script.

	* ltconfig.in (export_dynamic_flag_spec): Use `--export-dynamic'
	instead of `-export-dynamic', which is not accepted by all GNU
	ld's.  From Eiichi Takamori.

	* ltmain.in (install): Don't print silly `library stripping'
	warnings.  Reported by François Pinard.

Fri Dec 19 08:24:32 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltmain.in: Don't forget to quote the CDPATH substitution.  From
 	Tor Lillqvist.

Thu Dec 18 07:10:27 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@profitpress.com>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (CDPATH): Unset this environment variable
 	so that HP-UX shells, at least, don't print out the directory name
 	after a `cd' command.  From Tor Lillqvist.

Wed Dec 10 23:00:12 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* demo/Makefile.am (hardcode): Change a bunch of references to
	`$(LIBS)' to `-lm', since we no longer put -lm in LIBS.

	* demo/configure.in: Delete the test for libm, since it is
	standard on every system.

	* demo/Makefile.am (libhello_la_LDFLAGS): Change to include -lm,
	in accordance with new inter-library dependency code.

	* ltmain.in (dependency_libs): Added to help people link programs
	without having to explicitly specify inter-library dependencies.

	* ltconfig.in (COLLECT_NAMES): Oops... I forgot to apply the AIX 3
 	restriction to the generated libtool script.  Reported by Stefan
 	Westerfeld.

Fri Dec  5 00:21:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (thisdir): Quote $echo in the generated libtool
	script for HP-UX.  From Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer.

	* ltmain.in (link): Recognize the `.s' suffix.  From Markus
	F.X.J. Oberhumer.

	* ltconfig.in (link_static_flag): Don't quote ${wl} on HP-UX
 	because link_static_flag is never evaled.  From Eric Backus.

Mon Dec  1 00:50:37 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* demo/Makefile.am (helldl_DEPENDENCIES): Add `libhello.la' to our
	dependencies so that parallel builds work correctly.  From Jim
	Meyering.

	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/ltconfig, $(srcdir)/ltmain.sh): Rewrite
	these rules so that they are parallelizable.  Reported by Jim
	Meyering.

	* ltconfig.in (ltecho): We need special handling to quote the
	`echo' variable itself.  From Alexandre Oliva.

Sat Nov 29 11:19:18 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (COLLECT_NAMES): Enable this workaround for a broken
 	collect2 only on AIX 3.  This avoids problems on other AIX
 	versions.  Reported by Stefan Westerfeld.

	* ltmain.in, ltconfig.in (finish_eval): Variable like finish_cmds,
	except it is a single command which is evaled, and not shown.

	* ltconfig.in: Port to AmigaOS.  From Joop van de Wege.

	* ltmain.in (echo): Delete preamble to check for a working echo,
 	since we just use the one included in the generated libtool.

	* ltconfig.in (echo): Include this definition in the generated
	libtool script.

Fri Nov 28 09:28:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in, libtool.m4 (NM): Add /usr/ccs/bin to the PATH
	before checking.  From Kaveh R. Ghazi.
	(NM): Delete an extraneous egrep from ltconfig.

	* ltconfig.in (finish_cmds): Change back to using `ldconfig -n'.
	This makes Linux behave like other systems, which is more in line
	with what libtool needs.

Thu Nov 27 08:53:05 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Change a whole bunch of `progname' variables to
	`modename'.  This is for clarity, and to fix a tiny typo in finish
	mode.

	* libtool.spec (Name, Version): Ditto.

	* configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use PRCS to automatically generate
	the proper package name and version number.

	* ltconfig.in (gnu_ld_acts_native): Treat GNU ld like the native
	linker on SunOS 4.x.  Suggested by Alexandre Oliva.
	(deplibs): Change the defaults all over, since most systems cannot
	handle inter-library depdencies.

	* libtool.m4, ltconfig.in (NM): Only look at the first line of the
 	output from NM when determining whether it supports a command line
 	option.  This prevents false positives on OSes which ignore
 	invalid flags, like HP-UX, which prints `nm: unknown option "B"
 	ignored'.  Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* ltconfig.in (finish_cmds): On Linux, update ld.so.cache by
 	removing the `-n' flag from ldconfig.  Suggested by Kenneth
 	Albanowski.

	* Makefile.am (maintainer-checkin, maintainer-release): New
	commands to reap the full benefit of using PRCS to maintain
	libtool version numbers.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (global_symbol_pipe): Explicitly cast all
	addresses to __ptr_t.  This fixes a bug due to a strict IRIX
	compiler.  Suggested by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

Sun Nov 23 09:29:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (echo): For aesthetics, avoid using `$echo' when
 	`echo' will do *exactly* the same thing.  This prevents ugly
 	`printf %s\n timestamp > some.lo' commands from appearing in the
 	libtool output.
	(link): Delete the `-allow-undefined' flag because it is now the
 	default.  Make `-no-undefined' in order for people to declare that
 	a library is entirely self-contained.  This prevents maintainers
 	from accidentally creating shared libraries that won't work on
 	AIX.  Reported by Stefan Westerfeld and Danny Backx.

	* ltconfig.in (echo): Use an echo variable, just as in ltmain.in,
	because we need it for quoting substitutions.  For most of the
	script, though, use the default echo, just like Autoconf does.
	Without this patch, character \001 ends up in global_symbol_pipe.
	Reported by Lars Hecking and Jürgen Fluk.

	* ltmain.in (echo): Set default to `echo=echo'.  Ooops.  That's
	what you get for testing obscure code paths and forgetting to
	revert to the original version.  Reported by Danny Backx.

Fri Nov 14 10:44:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_libdir_flag_spec): Set to `-R' for FreeBSD
 	2.2.  From Sean Kelly.
	(postuninstall_cmds, old_postuninstall_cmds): Commands to run
 	after uninstall mode deletes the libraries.  Suggested by Joop van
	de Wege.
	(export_dynamic_flag_spec): On HP-UX, add the `${wl}-E'
	export_dynamic_flag_spec.  Reported by Matthias Hoelzer.

Tue Nov 11 15:05:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (sed_quote_subst): Oops.  We forgot to
 	quote backticks.  Reported by Joop van de Wege.

Sun Nov  9 18:36:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (symcode): On IRIX, don't extract undefined
	symbols.  When a function is inlined by G++, references to it are
	still marked as undefined in the object file.  This means that our
	symbol file causes undefined references, because there are
	actually no matching global symbols.  Reported by Paul Kendall.

Sat Nov  8 08:11:26 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in: Don't forget to redirect the COLLECT_NAMES libtool
	script fragment to the generated libtool, rather than to stdout.

Fri Nov  7 11:31:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Add a more sophisticated test to determine the
 	ABI flag on IRIX 6.  Suggested by Lars Hecking and Ian Lance
 	Taylor.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (COLLECT_NAMES): Only export this
	variable if we are running under AIX.  Otherwise, we tickle a g++
	bug under IRIX.  From Paul Kendall.

	* Change bug reporting address to <bug-libtool@gnu.org>.

	* ltconfig.in (allow_undefined_flag): OSF/1 3.x also requires a
 	wildcard argument to `-expect_unresolved'.  From Stephan Kulow.

Thu Nov  6 08:11:25 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (link): Use libname_spec.

	* ltconfig.in (pic_flag): Somehow, the HP-UX pic_flag (`+Z') was
 	dropped between libtool-1.0 and now.  Add it back in.  Reported by
	Akim Demaille.
	Integrated more patches for OS/2.  From Jeff Freedman.
	(libname_spec): New variable for OSes that don't require their
	libraries to look like `libNAME.a'.

	* ltmain.in (link): Only use global_symbol_pipe if it has been
	defined.  From Stephan Kulow.

	* ltconfig.in (global_symbol_pipe): Protect C fragment under C++
	compilers.  From Stephan Kulow.

	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/acinclude.m4,
	$(srcdir)/demo/acinclude.m4): Change rules to use LN_S so that
	they can be run on any system.

	* ltconfig.in (archive_cmds): For NetBSD, don't include deplibs.
	From Dieter Baron.

	* ltmain.in (mkdir): Check that the directory doesn't exist before
 	we exit with error, so that we don't get races during parallel
 	builds.  From H. J. Lu.
	(fbsd_hideous_sh_bug): Apparently, some FreeBSD /bin/sh's have a
 	bug that will empty base_compile unless we do this dummy
 	assignment.  From Marc van Kempen.

Wed Oct 22 10:27:45 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (libtool_shared, libtool_static): Fixed logic error
	to reenable override of libtool's defaults by setting
	enable_shared or enable_static in configure.in.  Reported by Tom
	Tromey and Stephan Kulow.

	* ltmain.in (link): Add explicit support for compiler options that
 	begin with `+'.  Reported by Aubert Pierre.

Mon Oct 20 13:21:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Silly me.  Change a bunch of occurances of "* $dir *"
	into *" $dir "*.

	* ltconfig.in (pic_flag): PIC is the default for AIX.  From Mark
	Kettenis.  It is also the default for OSF/1.

	* demo/Makefile.am (objdir): Quote double-quotes.  From Mark
	Kettenis.

	* ltconfig.in (global_symbol_pipe): This variable is not
 	double-evaled, so it should not be double quoted.  From Mark
 	Kettenis.

Sun Oct 19 12:48:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (LD): Same as below.

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Set LD if we discover an absolute path to GNU
 	ld.  This prevents breakage when `$CC -print-prog-name=ld' returns
 	an absolute directory name.  Reported by Ulrich Drepper.

	* ltconfig.in: Port to OS/2 using EMX.  From Jeff Freedman.

	* ltmain.in (link): Use old_archive_from_new_cmds.

	* ltconfig.in (old_archive_from_new_cmds): New variable to
	support DLL libraries.

	* ltmain.in (link): Only `eval' export_dynamic_flag_spec if it is
	not empty.  Reported by Stephan Kulow.

Sat Oct 18 00:44:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltconfig.in (objdir): Use the .libs directory on all systems for
 	which that name is valid, and _libs on the others (like MS-DOS).
  	Suggested by Juergen Erhard.

Tue Oct 14 10:19:18 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (link): Added a bit more inter-language support to the
 	symbol file generation process.
	Instead of complaining about unrecognized argument suffices, pass
	them to the linker.  This prevents libtool from barfing on
	mandatory arguments to linker flags.  Reported by Michael
	Tiemann.

Thu Oct  9 12:56:13 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.in (link): Change the wrapper script to follow symlinks
	in order to find thisdir.  This should put the final nail in the
	coffin for problems with wrapper scripts.  From Ian Lance Taylor.

Tue Oct  7 10:49:29 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.in: Change a few `$echo' commands into `$show' to make
	--silent mode behave as advertised.

	* ltconfig.in (allow_undefined_flag): On OSF/1 4.x, use
 	`-expect_unresolved \*'.  From Christian Mondrup.

	* ltmain.in (install): Change install mode to allow a specified
	/bin/sh argument at the beginning of the install_prog.  Also,
	specify the shell to run when invoking libtool recursively for
	finish mode.  From Chris Provenzano.

	* libtool.m4 (LIBTOOL): Change definition to include $(SHELL).
	From Chris Provenzano.

	* ltconfig.in: Port to UTS 4.x.  From Alistair Crooks.

	* demo/Makefile.am (hc-libflag): Add rules to make this binary for
	hardcode.test.

Wed Sep 24 19:54:53 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (LD): As with libtool.m4, don't override LD.
	Do a whole bunch of ac_t quoting.

Wed Sep 24 11:11:01 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PROG_LD): Don't override LD in the environment.

Sun Sep 21 13:13:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4, ltconfig.in (NM): Arguments to the for loop must be
	whitespace separated.  This fixes a bug under FreeBSD's /bin/sh.
	From George Scott.

Sat Sep 20 13:59:47 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.in (deplibs): When building shared libraries, always add
	-lc to deplibs.  Reported by Andreas Jellinghaus.

Mon Sep 15 07:08:35 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (COLLECT_NAMES): If the COLLECT_NAMES
	environment variable has not been set, set it to empty.  This
	apparently fixes the AIX bug with GCC's collect2.  Reported by
	Mark Kettenis.

	* demo/Makefile.am, ltmain.in, tests/hardcode.test (objdir):
 	Changed objdir variable .libs to _libs.  This is another MS-DOS
 	portability fix.  Suggested by Robert Hoehne.

Sat Sep 13 11:41:44 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.in (hardcode_minusL): Fix typo by renaming
 	hardcode_minusL to hardcode_minus_L.  Also add FreeBSD
 	hardcode_libdir_flag_spec. From Paul Traina.

	* ltmain.in (link): Honour multiple `-rpath' flags when linking
	programs.  Suggested by Bengt Martensson.
	Quote appearances of $echo in the wrapper script.  From Alexandre
	Oliva.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, tests/tlibtool: Use ltmain.in instead
 	of ltmain.sh.in.

	* ltmain.in: Rename ltmain.sh.in to ltmain.in.  This fixes a
	portability problem (on MS-DOS, of all places!).  From Robert
	Hoehne.

Thu Sep 11 21:14:26 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Do not transform libtool objects to regular
	objects if we did not build old libs.  Reported by Tomas Hiller.

Fri Sep  5 13:11:38 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am (hell_debug_LDFLAGS): Change hell.static to
	hell.debug in order to reflect the new static linking semantics.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add new `-all-static' flag to prevent all
	dynamic linking.  The old `-static' flag just prevents dynamic
	linking against libtool libraries.  Suggested by Bengt
	Martensson.

	* ltconfig.in (with_gnu_ld): Add a test to make sure that we are
	actually using GNU ld.  This fixes an inconsistency when running
	ltconfig without using libtool.m4.  Reported by Ulrich Drepper.
	(global_symbol_pipe): Delete symbols that are not valid C
	identifiers.  Reported by Johan Danielsson and Bengt Martensson.

Thu Sep  4 21:53:08 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (echo): Quote all the uses of `echo' in all eval
	statements.  Reported by Bengt Martensson and Alexandre Oliva.
	(echo): Need to surround test args with double quotes, or the echo
	test fails on Digital Unix 4.0.  From Todd Kover.

Thu Aug 28 20:58:56 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (echo): Change test to one that uses printf.
	This works on AIX, which has the same problems that Solaris does,
	but no working echo program.

Wed Aug 27 09:54:21 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Make sure that compile_command and
 	finalize_command are always evaled.  Quote any unknown linker
 	flags we need to pass through.
	(compile): Use quoting for flags we pass.
	(echo): I hate Sun!  The /usr/bin/echo on Solaris handles
	backslash sequences, which makes it impossible to do backslash
	quoting using echo and sed.  So, we search for an echo that obeys
	the `echo '\t'` = '\t' equality.  Then we use `$echo' everywhere
	in ltmain.sh.
	Put tabs back into the ${IFS= 	} sequences.  Emacs untabify is
	libtool bane.

	* ltconfig.in: Quote all variable values that may contain
	metacharacters creating the libtool script.  This provides
	complete protection, so that even single-quotes may appear inside
	a libtool variable value.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Quote finalize_command before putting it in
 	the wrapper script.

Tue Aug 26 13:32:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (sed_quote_subst): Change the quoting procedure
 	again.  I think that the new one is robust for *all* characters,
 	including whitespace and metacharacters.

Mon Aug 25 10:54:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Change quoting procedure because some shells
 	cannot handle `]' in scan sets.  From Ian Dall.

Fri Aug 22 11:00:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (execute): Added -dlopen flag handling.  Suggested
	by Alexandre Oliva.

Thu Aug 21 00:40:45 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Change executable wrapper to fix up value
	of thisdir, as well as progdir, if the $0 path doesn't work.  This
	guarantees that shlibpath_var is set correctly.  Add support for
	execute mode.

	* ltmain.sh.in (execute): New mode to automatically set
 	shlibpath_var, which allows easy debugging of uninstalled
 	executables and libraries.  Suggested by Kenneth Albanowski.

Wed Aug 20 10:51:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/ltconfig): Use lineno.

	* configure.in: Add AM_PROG_AWK for lineno.

	* lineno: New program to automatically put line numbers in
	ltconfig.

	* libtool.m4, ltconfig.in (AM_PROG_LD): Yet Another Rewrite, which
	incorporates the results of `gcc -print-program-name=ld'.
	Suggested by Alexandre Oliva.

Thu Aug 14 09:30:47 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Accept `--quiet' and `--silent' flags to turn off
 	command echoing.  From Juergen A. Erhard.

	(compile): Recognize the Objective C `.m' extension.  From Juergen
 	A. Erhard.

	(compile): Suppress error output from the second compilation (if
 	any) so that we don't get those frustrating duplicate error
 	messages.

Tue Aug 12 09:36:59 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Added messages to config.log to describe what sort
 	of test we are running.
	(pic_flag): Added a sanity check for pic_flag.  This should fix
 	bugs reported using the cc bundled with HP-UX 10.  Suggested by
 	Bruno Haible and Akim Demaille.

Fri Aug  1 10:06:55 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add -dlopen and -dlpreopen support for
	libtool objects.  This means that dlopened modules no longer need
	to be shared libraries.

	* ltconfig.in (pic_flag): GCC on IRIX 6 always builds PIC.
	Reported by Ian Lance Taylor.

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Always add `-n32' to the linker if we are using
	GCC on IRIX 6.  Reported by Ian Lance Taylor.

Wed Jul 30 13:11:09 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PROG_LIBTOOL): Explicitly check enable_shared and
 	enable_static rather than just enableval.  This allows
 	configure.in scripts to set their own defaults.  Suggested by
 	Tommy Reilly.

Tue Jul 29 11:52:10 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Add NLS environment variable handling copied from
	ltconfig.in.  Reported by Akim Demaille.
	(link): If allow_undefined_flag is not supported, then turn on old
	libraries.  Reported by Akim Demaille.

	* demo/dlmain.c (main): Use dld_preloaded_symbol_count to display
	a message about the sortedness of the symbol table.

	* ltconfig.in (nlist): Use an nlist convenience variable, so that
 	code can be shared directly with ltmain.sh.in.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (dld_preloaded_symbol_count): Count up
 	the number of symbols in the dld_preloaded_symbols.  Set to `-1'
 	if the list wasn't both sorted and counted.  This allows
 	applications to do a quick binary search, if they are so inclined.

Fri Jul 25 10:13:49 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Remove code for `-version-file', since it
 	has been long-deprecated.

	Disable static linking if hardcode_direct is unsupported and there
 	is no working link_static_flag.  This provides correct behaviour
 	for all cases on AIX 3, regardless of whether collect2 is broken
 	or not.  Reported by Mark Kettenis.

	* ltconfig.in: Fix typo in test polarity.  From Mark Kettenis.

Thu Jul 24 10:42:30 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_direct): Set to `unsupported' if aix3 uses
	a broken collect2.  Adapted out of test results from Mark
	Kettenis.
	(link_static_flag): Make sure the link_static_flag actually works
	with a trivial binary.

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in (export_dynamic_flag_spec): Renamed
 	from export_dynamic_flag because we eval it in ltmain.sh.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link_static): Don't eval link_static_flag.

	* demo/dlmain.c (main): Change function prototype to be KNR
 	compatible.  From Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use no_builtin_flag.  This works around
	conflicting definitions of builtin functions with at least GCC.
	Reported by Kazuhiro Sasayama.

	* ltconfig.in (no_builtin_flag): New flag to turn off builtin
	functions when compiling an object file.
	(pipe_works): Use it.

Wed Jul 23 08:18:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (pic_flag): According to the libg++ 2.7.2 configure
 	script, DEC alpha CPUs are PIC-only, as well.  Reported by Kevin
 	Jacobs.

Mon Jul 21 09:46:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in: Replace all occurances of "sed 'X;
 	Y'" with "sed -e 'X' -e 'Y'".

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Finish full integration for `-dlopen' and
 	`-dlpreopen'.

	Fix two silly typos where I used a compile_command in place of a
	finalize_command, and vice versa.

	Change the wrapper script to check a hardcoded path only if the
	argv[0] method fails.  This is a compromise for the previous two
	patches, and should solve the majority of problems with wrapper
	scripts.  From Kenneth Albanowski.

	(link): Change a reference to hardcode_libdir_colon_separated to
	use the new hardcode_libdir_separator variable.

	* demo/Makefile.am (helldl_LDFLAGS): Add `-export-dynamic' and
	`-dlpreopen' for building helldl.

	* demo/dlmain.c (main): Succeed, even if none of the libhello
	symbols have been preloaded.

Sun Jul 20 10:17:04 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (global_symbol_pipe): Add `U' to the accepted global
 	symbol types.  This means that we will get duplicate symbols, but
 	we'll also be sure to get all global symbols used by the program.

	* ltconfig.in (pipe_works), ltmain.sh.in (link): Sort and make
	symbol output unique.

Sat Jul 19 21:54:33 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (pipe_works): Check to make sure our guessed
	global_symbol_pipe actually works.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Revert change from Kenneth Albanowski.  The
 	wrapper scripts are more reliable when they just use the argv[0]
 	value.  Generally, when the argv[0] method doesn't work, the user
 	is trying to do something weird with an uninstalled binary, and
 	should try a different approach.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (CC): Always use `$CC' instead of
 	`$cc'.  This fixes a FreeBSD bug.  Reported by Chuck Robey, and
 	others.

Mon Jul 14 22:26:15 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): In wrapper scripts, hardcode the current
 	directory to prevent phony argv[0] values from screwing up our
	program.  From Kenneth Albanowski.

Sun Jul 13 19:14:32 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Add demo/dlmain.c to the
	distribution.

Sat Jul 12 10:07:28 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am: Add helldl, made from dlmain.c, to demostrate
	`-dlopen' usage.

	* demo/dlmain.c: New file to demonstrate preloaded modules.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add `-dlopen' flag to preload dynamic
 	modules, even on static platforms.  Use `$NM' and
	`$global_symbol_cmd' to extract symbols from required files.
	(dlname): Delete dlname mode entirely.  It is rendered obsolete
	because the `.la' file format is now a public interface.

	* ltconfig.in (NM): New variable for BSD-compatible nm program.
	(global_symbol_cmd): Pipeline to extract global symbols from the
	nm output.

	* ltmain.sh.in: The .la file header should depend on `ltmain.sh',
 	not `$PROGRAM'.
	(link): Make sure $export_dynamic_flag is eval'ed before it is
 	used.

Fri Jul 11 19:33:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.spec: New Red Hat Package Manager specification file in
	order to help people prepare distributions of libtool for Linux.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Eliminate two accidental uses of the NONE magic
 	value.  These were breaking libtool's behaviour when no mode is
 	specified.

Tue Jul  8 11:01:27 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 1.0.

	* ltconfig.in: On SunOS, append /usr/etc to the PATH before
 	running ldconfig; on *BSD, append /sbin.  This was done in line
 	with the Linux change suggested by Kenneth Albanowski.

	* demo/Makefile.am (hardcode_tests): Aesthetic change to
	alphabetize order of compiling the hardcode tests.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Delete README-automake.

	* README-automake: Remove from distribution.

Wed Jul  2 19:13:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): In the executable wrapper, strip trailing
 	colons from the shlibpath_var because some ld.so's, notably
 	OpenBSD 2.0's (!), don't parse colon-terminated values correctly.
  	From Tim Pierce.

Tue Jul  1 13:03:49 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in: Eliminate uses of the NONE magic
	variable value.  Use an empty variable instead.

	* ltconfig.in (with_gcc, with_gnu_ld): Do the tests for the C
	compiler and linker if the variables are unset, or if they are not
	GNU C and ld.
	(RANLIB): Eliminate redundant `if' statement.

	* configure.in: Use AM_PROG_LD.

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PROG_LD_GNU): New macro to determine if LD is GNU
	ld.
	(AM_PROG_LD): Rename AM_PATH_PROG_LD to AM_PROG_LD.  Parameterize
	so that the user can specify `--with-gnu-ld' or `--without-gnu-ld'
	to indicate his preference.
	(AM_PROG_LIBTOOL): Use it.

Mon Jun 30 22:32:05 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Append /sbin to the path before running ldconfig on
 	Linux.  This helps superusers who haven't set their PATH
 	correctly.  Suggested by Kenneth Albanowski.

Sun Jun 29 19:51:50 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Change all the `eval "$run ..."' sequences to
 	`$run "eval ..."'.

	Change all `$ln_s ...' sequences to use `(cd /dir && $LN_S ...)'.
	This is the sequence recommended by the Autoconf manual, and
	should avoid any problems on older machines.  Eliminate all uses
	of `cp -p'.  Reported by Akim Demaille.

	(install): Use `test $# -gt 0' instead of `test -n "$1"'.

	* ltconfig.in (LN_S): Add test to see if `ln -s' works.

	* libtool.m4: Increment serial number, and require AC_PROG_LN_S.

Thu Jun 26 17:55:26 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add missing `test' statement.  Reported by
	Akim Demaille.

Tue Jun 24 14:58:41 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Consistently use ac_cv_path_ld instead of
	am_cv_path_ld.  From Tim Pierce.

Fri Jun 20 08:21:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Redo two robustness fixes.  Alexandre had the
 	correct approach, but I botched them.

	* ltconfig.in (dynamic_linker): Disable shared libraries on
 	MkLinux unless GNU libc is in use.  Reported by Akim Demaille.

Thu Jun 19 14:24:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Add a missing `test' command.  Reported
	by Joel Weber.
	Miscellaneous fixes to improve robustness.  From Alexandre Oliva.

Sat Jun 14 21:01:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Create invalid libtool objects when partial
	linking if we don't have PIC.  From Jeff Dairiki.
	(install): Fix bug if libtool object is installed to a file name
	without directory components.  From Jeff Dairiki.

Fri Jun 13 14:18:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo/configure): Fix up rules to run autoconf.
	(aclocal.m4): Now we depend on our own libtool.m4.

	* configure.in (AM_PATH_PROG_LD): Use it.

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PATH_PROG_LD): New macro to find the linker used
	by the C compiler.
	(AM_PROG_LIBTOOL): Use it.

	* ltmain.sh.in (install, uninstall): Support installing and
	uninstalling `.lo' files.  From Jeff Dairiki.

Wed Jun 11 11:04:59 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (ltconfig, ltmain.sh): Only move if $(srcdir) is not
	the current directory.  Don't regenerate every time the package is
	reconfigured.  Reported by Tom Tromey.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Added ltconfig, ltmain.sh, so that
	$(srcdir) is not messed with during a regular clean.

Tue Jun 10 12:26:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (ltconfig, ltmain.sh): Be sure to move these files
	into $(srcdir) once they are created.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Disable building static libraries.
	People should use their favourite AR and RANLIB commands.
	Disable building old-style objects if `--disable-static' is
	given.  Suggested by Tom Lees and Stephan Kulow.

Sun Jun  8 12:10:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (host_cpu, host_vendor, host_os): Patch up
 	definitions, to allow for the fact that the host_os may contain
 	hyphens (as in linux-gnu).  From Scott Goehring.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Move the `dlname' setting closer to the top
	of the file.  Suggested by David Mosberger-Tang.
	Symlink the libtool archive into the `.libs' directory so that it
	can be found by programs that want to find a library's dlname by
	searching LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Reported by David Mosberger-Tang.

Fri Jun  6 15:52:28 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Tell people to report bugs to the new libtool mailing list,
	<bug-libtool@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

Thu Jun  5 10:40:15 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (allow_undefined_flag): New variable that implements
	`-allow-undefined'.
	(archive_cmds): Enable C++ constructors for FreeBSD 2.2.  From
	David Nugent.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Accept new `-allow-undefined' flag when
 	building libtool libraries.  This tells libtool to allow
 	unresolved symbols to exist in shared libraries.  Basically, this
 	turns off shared libraries on AIX.  Suggested by Ian Lance Taylor.

Mon May 26 08:24:55 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): On at least IRIX, many different flags need to
	be propagated to the linker if they are part of the compiler
	command line.  Reported by Anthony Green.

Sat May 10 12:21:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to FreeBSD 3.  From David Nugent.

Fri Apr 25 13:23:33 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Remove all traces of `-whole-archive',
	`-no-whole-archive', and libtool convenience libraries.  They were
	more trouble than they're worth.  If these are ever reimplemented,
	they need more careful attention to make portable.

	* libtool.m4, ltconfig.in: Added a `--disable-static' flag to turn
	off static library creation.  From Tom Lees (who finally convinced
	me that it was the Right Thing to do).

Tue Apr 22 12:41:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_runpath_var, runpath_var): Use them, if
	the linker has no -rpath flag.
	Quote the values we use to set runpath_var and shlibpath_var.
	(link): Use libobjlibs for libtool convenience libraries.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_runpath_var, runpath_var): Add new
	variables to describe linkers that honour `LD_RUN_PATH'.
	(host_cpu, host_os): Use these more specific variables, rather
	than the full canonical host system name.

	* ltmain.sh.in (dlname): Distinguish between missing
 	`-export-dynamic' and when the library is only statically linked.

Mon Apr 21 09:52:51 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to OpenBSD by making it an alias for
	NetBSD.  From Tim Pierce.

Wed Apr 16 19:32:05 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Temporary measures to check for a broken collect2
	program.  Right now, we just see if we're using GCC on AIX 3.

Sun Apr 13 19:40:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (mode): Use `egrep -e' when inferring the operation
	mode.

Sat Apr 12 13:09:24 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (linker): Some GNU ld's don't accept `--version',
	but do accept `-v'.  From Jukka Honkela.
	(ld_shlibs): AIX lossage may be settling down.  AIX 3.2.5 ld does
 	*not* hardcode direct libraries, but AIX 4.1.[45] ld does.

Mon Apr  7 09:39:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_action): Fix silly logic error.  From
	Bruno Haible.

Sat Apr  5 11:26:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Relink if hardcode_action is `relink',
	rather than using complex conditionals based on the other
	hardcode variables.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_action): Set to `relink', not `immediate',
 	if we can only hardcode existing directories.  Rearrange
 	conditionals to make the intent clearer, otherwise this can be one
 	hellish piece of code for the already-dizzy libtool maintainer.

Wed Apr  2 10:36:31 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* replfunc.m4: Delete from the distribution.  Documentation now
	describes how to set LTALLOCA and LTLIBOBJS in your own
	configure.in.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Make sure a libtool library only counts as
	a shared library if its library_names are non-null.
	Use timestamps for .lo's when PIC is turned off, rather than
	symlinking to the real object.  This helps invalid mixtures of PIC
	and non-PIC to fail.

Tue Apr  1 10:01:20 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute libtool.prj.

	* Shameless plug: Changed source code management system from CVS
	to PRCS.

	* libtool.scm: Initial Guile implementation of libtool.

	* ltmain.sh.in: An unexpected inconsistency in my whole approach
 	to shared libraries has proven that libtool needs to be completely
 	rewritten if I'm going to give full shared library support for
 	platforms that don't use the GNU C library version 2 (which to my
 	knowledge currently only works on GNU Hurd and Linux/GNU systems).
  	Porting the GNU C library should not be difficult, though.

	Platforms that don't have the dlopen(3) family of functions will
 	need to install GNU DLD version 4 in order to build any kind of
 	libraries at all.  Unfortunately, DLD 4 won't be released for a
 	while, because I maintain it, and I'm too busy working on libtool.

	I'll keep the old ltconfig/ltmain.sh implementation around for as
 	long as I can, and continue applying bug fixes, so that I'll have
 	a reasonable starting point for this new libtool implementation.

	It looks like this implementation will be even more complex than
 	the original (pre-0.7) libtool.  Initial estimates show that it
 	may be up to 3 times slower, and 5 times larger than libtool-0.9.
  	I'll probably have to rewrite it in Guile to get reasonable
 	performance, which will severely limit its portability for a
 	while.

	That will also introduce a bootstrapping issue, since the next
 	release of Guile will use libtool to build shared libraries.  So,
 	if users want to have shared Guile libraries, they will have to
 	configure Guile with `--disable-shared', compile it, install it,
 	then reconfigure Guile with `--enable-shared' and repeat.

	I was hoping to get libtool 1.0 out the door by early April, but
 	now it looks like it will take at least another year before it'll
 	be usable by the public at large.  April fools.  libtool.scm
	doesn't exist yet, either.

	* ltconfig.in (verify_host): Remove redundant `Transform *-*-linux*
	to *-*-linux-gnu*'.  From Bruno Haible.

Mon Mar 31 16:15:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Use the new AUTOMAKE and ACLOCAL variables.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Only fail if a convenience library doesn't
	exist, and the user specified -whole-archive.
	Fix shell quoting that was breaking @OUTPUT@ substitution.

Fri Mar 28 19:09:08 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use the hardcode_libdir_separator.
	Convenience libraries are libtool objects if we're not building
	libtool libs.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_libdir_separator): Added in case the
 	linker only honours the last of the -rpath flags (but it can
 	contain multiple colon-separated directories), such as on OSF/1.
  	Reported by Carl D. Roth.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Set the dlname if -export-dynamic is given.
	(install, uninstall): Handle the dlname file separately.

	* ltconfig.in (export_dynamic_flag): Added to allow programs to
	use reflexive dlopens.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Include the mode name in any help messages.
	(dlname): New mode to give the name to be used with dlopen(3).

	* ltconfig.in (AR): Allow AR to be set by the user, and export it
	to ltmain.sh.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Remove broken profiled library support.
	Added `-whole-archive' and `-no-whole-archive' to manipulate
	convenience libraries.

Thu Mar 27 15:55:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Allow the creation of static convenience
	libraries made of libtool objects.  Suggested by David
	Mosberger-Tang.

Tue Mar 25 08:38:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: On AIX, libtool also needs to look for `B' symbols
 	in nm output.  These are global variable definitions.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Linking with -static should link against the
	linklib if old_library is empty (like it is on AIX).

	* ltconfig.in: Change the order of OS detection, so that
 	linux-gnu* is detected before gnu*.

	* Makefile.am (libtool): Use the correct CC, RANLIB, LD, when
	generating libtool.  From Carl D. Roth.

	* configure.in: Find out the user-supplied CC, LD, RANLIB.  From
	Carl D. Roth.

Mon Mar 24 01:26:48 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Linking with -static should link against the old
	library, not linklib.

	* README-automake: Updated to point to Automake 1.1m.

Sat Mar 15 14:15:43 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/main.c: Use it.

	* demo/foo.h: Declare it.

	* demo/foo.c: Added definition of `nothing' so that we have an
	global variable definition, as well as functions.

Wed Mar 12 19:00:44 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Make sure either enable_shared or enable_static is
	configured.  Reported by Tom Tromey.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Bomb out if no library types are configured.

Sat Feb 22 12:47:59 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_libdir_flag_spec): Renamed
 	from `hardcode_libdir_flag'.
	(library_names_spec): Renamed from `lib_names'.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_action): Change value from
 	`rpath' to `immediate'.

	* replfunc.m4: Add AM_FUNC_ALLOCA, AM_FUNC_MEMCMP, and
 	AM_STRUCT_ST_BLOCKS.

Tue Feb 18 09:36:24 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Transform *-*-linux* to *-*-linux-gnu* to support
	old-style config.guess scripts.

Mon Feb 17 23:30:32 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Create objdir *before* linking a program into it.

Wed Feb 12 01:20:45 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Any ld --version that returns GNU is probably a GNU
	ld.  From Marcus Daniels.

	* libtool.m4: Added AM_REPLACE_FUNCS.

Tue Feb 11 01:28:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to *-*-osf4.  From Bruno Haible.

Mon Feb 10 09:54:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: AIX 3 and 4 ld only hardcodes LIBPATH if -L is not
 	specified.  This behaviour is the same with both xlc and gcc.

Fri Feb  7 08:37:54 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* doc/platforms.texi: Yaay!  We found a workaround for HP-UX
	/bin/sh buffer overflows.  From Eric Backus.

Mon Feb  3 11:15:01 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.9.

	* PLATFORMS, doc/platforms.texi, Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am:
	Move PLATFORMS to doc/platforms.texi.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use hardcode_libdir_flag to get a library
	directory into the resulting binary.
	Use hardcode_action, and make many simplifying changes to have
	compilation and finalization be consistent with each other.

	* ltconfig.in: Not so amazing!  It's AIX cc that hardcodes direct
	libraries... gcc doesn't, though.
	(link_rpath_flag): Change link_rpath_flag to be
	hardcode_libdir_flag.
	(hardcode_action): New variable to simplify ltmain.sh.

Wed Jan 29 12:58:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Change to take advantage of linkers that don't
	hardcode direct libraries.

	* ltconfig.in: Amazing!  AIX 3 linker doesn't hardcode direct
	libraries, which makes it less buggy than AIX 4.  Reported by Mark
	Kettenis.

	* demo/configure.in: Check for the math library.

	* demo/foo.c (foo): Change to use the `cos' function, so that we
	need to link against another library.

Tue Jan 28 20:32:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Export the PATH variable in order to find
	the program, rather than giving a full path.  This helps give the
	program a less confusing value for argv[0].

Sun Jan 26 15:50:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.8.

Fri Jan 24 23:32:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Add demo/acinclude.m4 to the
 	distribution.

Wed Jan 22 17:22:17 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4: For IRIX 6, ld needs -n32 if cc uses it.  Reported
	by Bruno Haible.

	* ltconfig.in: IRIX ld does not hardcode direct libraries.
  	Reported by Bruno Haible.

Sat Jan 18 15:15:12 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_shlibpath_var): Allow new
	value, `unsupported', since most linkers do not allow you to use
	shlibpath_var for initial linking.

	* ltconfig.in: Lots of bug fixes from Bruno Haible.  Set wl on
	OSF/1, fix definitions of hardcode_* variables.
	(archive_cmds): Fix not to use +h on HP-UX 9.x.  Reported by Bruno
	Haible.

Fri Jan 17 09:58:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtoolize.in: Handle explicit AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR settings.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

	* libtool.m4: Change ltconfig line to use $CONFIG_SHELL when it is
 	specified.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

Thu Jan 16 17:57:38 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am (hc-direct): Do better searching for the proper
	name to do a direct link.
	(hc-libpath): Make allowances if shlibpath_var cannot be used
	to find libraries at link time, such as on AIX.

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Remove ansi2knr.1 and ansi2knr.c.

	* demo/foo.c, demo/hello.c, demo/main.c: Change ANSI prototypes to
 	KNR form, for better portability, and less ansi2knr hair.

	* demo/configure.in: Remove AM_FUNC_PROTOTYPES.

	* demo/Makefile.am: Remove ansi2knr from the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.

	* demo/ansi2knr.1, demo/ansi2knr.c: Removed these files.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Use 1>&2 consistently to direct errors and
	warnings to stderr.
	(compile): Fix missing single quote.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_direct): On Solaris at least, using
 	DIR/libNAME.so does not hardcode DIR, so introduce a new hardcode
 	variable to reflect that.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): If linking with $link_static_flag fails,
 	then retry without it, but still use the .a versions of
 	uninstalled libtool archives.

Wed Jan 15 08:59:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Eval $link_static_flag.  Reported by Bruno
	Haible.

	* PLATFORMS: Add to distribution.  Suggested by Bruno Haible.

Mon Jan 13 12:59:29 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Add support for SCO OpenServer 5.x.

	(can_build_shared): Initialize at the top of the file, so that
 	shared libraries aren't built on platforms that don't support
 	them.

Sat Jan 11 13:29:08 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in, libtoolize.in, doc/libtool.texi:
 	Update the copyright completion years.

Wed Jan  8 15:01:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Port to IRIX 5.3, 6.2.

Mon Jan  6 08:54:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: HP-UX 9 support is the same as HP-UX 10, so the
	port is trivial.

	* libtoolize.in: Add --dry-run option, -n for short.

Fri Jan  3 17:26:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): On at least SunOS, /bin/sh doesn't
	understand "export something=val".  From Bruno Haible.

Thu Jan  2 13:04:17 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (compile): Recognize valid source file suffixes for
	Fortran and C++.

Tue Dec 17 23:17:17 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Don't allow *._o and *.l_o to be valid
 	object type suffixes, in spite of Automake's current ansi2knr
 	implementation.  Not all compilers allow non-`.o' suffixes.

Mon Dec 16 20:16:35 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Delete the `libtool' version type.

Thu Dec 12 00:04:27 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Use the full autoconf syntax when checking for GNU
	C.  Delete library stripping program, until we have a correct
	test.

Wed Dec 11 11:41:33 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: On AIX 3, use /usr/ucb/nm, not /ucb/nm.  From
	ir. M.M. Kettenis.

Mon Dec  9 12:06:31 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	Reported by Charles Kerr:
	* doc/libtool.texi (Creating Object Files): Doc fix independant ->
	independent.

	* ltconfig.in (ld_shlibs): SunOS 4 doesn't support shared library
	dependencies.

Sun Dec  8 14:39:04 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.7.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add README-automake to the
	distribution.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): When linking libtool libraries, use
	standard objects if they are PIC.  This prevents spurious warnings
	about invalid suffixes on AIX.

	* demo/Makefile.am: Rename libhell to libhello, so that we're not
	quite as offensive.

	* ltconfig.in: Remove unnecessary host validity checking.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Don't force people to use libNAME.la: SOMETHING.la
	is good enough (for consistency with *.a handling).

Sat Dec  7 12:31:15 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Accept files ending in .a as standard
	object files.  Reported by Ulrich Drepper.
	Remove support for creating profiled libraries (for now).
	Transform all library objects into standard objects when linking a
	program.

	* ltconfig.in (thisdir): How embarrassing!  An error in the regexp
	for finding the directory component of the script path.

Thu Dec  5 14:19:21 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (compile): Support `.S' (preprocessed assembler)
 	files.  Reported by Anthony Green.

	* libtoolize.in: Give clearer instrutions for how to update
	aclocal.m4.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (link): Add support for creating
 	reloadable objects.

Wed Dec  4 00:42:53 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Fix passing -n flag to `libtool
 	--finish'.
	(compile): Compile `.lo' and `.o' objects at the same time so that
 	non-PIC objects (if they are available) can be used for linking
 	into programs and creating static archives.  Suggested by Ulrich
	Drepper.

Tue Dec  3 10:43:22 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Give the full path to the libtool library
	when sourcing it.

	* ltconfig.in (old_striplib): Do a configuration test to determine
	if old-style libraries actually can be stripped or not.

Mon Dec  2 13:57:28 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Delete reference to ABOUT-LIBS.

	* tests: Added new subdirectory.

	* doc/libtool.texi: Doc fixes, and finished up the Configuring
	chapter.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Allow *._o and *.l_o to be valid object
	file suffixes, for Automake's ansi2knr implementation.
	New option -version-info replaces -version-file.

	[help]: Give a pointer to mode-specific help when appropriate.

	* ltconfig.in: Changed messages to correspond to AM_PROG_CC_STDC.

	* demo: Also test Automake's ansi2knr support.

Tue Nov 19 14:09:27 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Bug fixes for AIX 4, and for static platforms.

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Fix for loops over arguments.
	Need to quote ${IFS= } -> "${IFS= }".
	(link): Fix soname_spec bug.  Create objdir whether or not we have
	shared libraries.

	* ltconfig.in: Check for library stripping program.
	Use test -f instead of test -e.

Mon Nov 18 20:10:42 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Don't run the RANLIB test unless RANLIB wasn't
	set.
	Be verbose about the environment variables we were configured
	with.

	* ltmain.sh.in (objdir): change to .libs.

Sat Nov 16 12:02:03 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Just plunge ahead with the
	installation... don't try to enforce dependencies.

Fri Nov 15 17:57:36 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Fix up $libdir to be $dest in install mode.

Sun Nov 10 13:08:04 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh: Finished rewrite of compile, link, and install
	modes.

	* New ChangeLog file for libtool-0.7, since I've totally rewritten
	libtool.

Fri Mar 15 14:21:15 1996  Gord Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* For historical reasons: this is when I started writing libtool.
