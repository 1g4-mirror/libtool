	* TODO: Update.

	* libtoolize.m4sh: Back out copying `install-sh' by libtoolize.
	* doc/libtool.texi (Distributing): Mention that we distribute
	`install-sh', but that non-Automake users will have to copy
	it by themselves.

	* config/ltmain.m4sh: New option `--verbose'/`-v' to enable
	override of `--silent'.  Verbose is the default behavior.
	* doc/libtool.texi (Invoking libtool): Document it.

	* m4/libtool.m4 (_LT_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER) [linux]: While "parsing"
	/etc/ld.so.conf, skip comments.
	Reported by Jens Elkner <elkner@linofee.org>.

2005-01-10  Peter O'Gorman  <peter@pogma.com>

	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_mode_link): Fix
	inherited_linker_flags so it puts it on the link line when
	linking shared libraries as well as when linking executables.
	Reported by: Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>

2005-01-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* libltdl/libltdl/lt__glibc.h: Move all exported slist
	symbols into the lt__* namespace.
	* libltdl/libltdl/lt__private.h, libltdl/libltdl/slist.h:
	Adjust includes.

	* tests/sh.test: After `set dummy [...]', check for `shift'
	within the same and following line.
	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_enable_tag, func_mode_install)
	(func_mode_link): Sprinkle `shift's all over to conform to this.

	* HACKING (Editing 'ChangeLog'): Follow the GCS with respect to
	attributions, and mention how to handle tiny changes.
	Reported by Alexandre Duret-Lutz <adl@src.lip6.fr>.

	* ChangeLog: Move 2004 change logs from here...
	* ChangeLog.2004: ...to here.

	* m4/argz.m4, m4/libtool.m4, m4/ltdl.m4, m4/ltoptions.m4,
	m4/ltsugar.m4, m4/ltversion.m4, m4/lt~obsolete.m4: RMS says,
	'I think the [license of autoconf macro files] should be:
	# This file is free software; the Free Software Foundation
	# gives unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it,
	# with or without modifications, as long as this notice is
	# preserved.'.

	* ChangeLog: Reformatting.
	* HACKING: Fix section numbering.
	(Editing 'ChangeLog'): New notes on ChangeLog entry format.

2005-01-09  Peter O'Gorman  <peter@pogma.com>

	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_extract_archives)
	(func_extract_an_archive): On darwin, uniq can not take the flags
	-cd together, thanks to Ralf for the fix, also ar does not accept
	N, so we use the fact that ar x libfoo.a foo.o will always extract
	the first foo.o in the archive and we then delete foo.o from the
	archive, which will also delete only the first foo.o, then rinse
	and repeat.
