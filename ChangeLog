	* demo/Makefile.am (objdir): Use `libtool --config' for
	extracting configuration values, since a given value may
	be present in each tag.
	(hc-libpath): Ditto.
	(hc-minusL): Ditto.
	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Add tagged configurations from
	the --with-tags option.
	(_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK): Factored out into separate configuration
	macros -- The interdependencies and running order are still
	immutable, and need a lot of work to fix.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG): Taken from the previous incarnation of
	_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK -- this macro is used both to create the
	primary (C language) libtool configuration from
	_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK and also to append tagged configurations from
	_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG.
	* NEWS:  Merged from multi-language-branch.
