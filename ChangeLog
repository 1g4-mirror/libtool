	* Makefile.am:
	* libtool.m4:
	* ltconfig.in:
	* ltmain.in:
	* doc/libtool.texi
	* tests/defs:

	The beginnings of multi-compiler/language support in libtool.

	Integrated Alexandre's configuration tags patch, part of Thomas'
	patch and part of my patch.

	These patches make it possible for libtool to support
	compilers besides C compilers.  This also includes support for
	linkers besides `ld', and similarly for other tools commonly used
	for development.  See the libtool documentation for more details.

	Moved all C compiler related configuration code to `ltcf-c.sh',
	described below.

	Multi-compiler/language still isn't complete but testing is now
	possible.

	* ltcf-c.sh:

	Added this file.  It contains all of the C compiler related
	configuration code that was previously in ltconfig.in.  This
	script is meant to be source by the ltconfig script alone.  It is
	not meant for use by the user.  Eventually, the contents of this
	file will be moved to `libtool.m4'.

	* ltcf-cxx.sh:

	Added this file.  It contains C++ compiler related configuration
	code (e.g. C++ compiler as linker, etc).  It is meant to be used
	when creating configuration tags using the newly added "--add-tag"
	ltconfig option.  See the libtool documentation for more details.
	Eventually, the contents of this file will be moved to
	`libtool.m4'.

	This script also includes support for extracting the objects and
	libraries the compiler would use when linking a C++ binary.  This
	support should allow static constructors and the like to work
	properly.
