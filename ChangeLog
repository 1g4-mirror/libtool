Thu Jul 24 10:42:30 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in (export_dynamic_flag_spec): Renamed
 	from export_dynamic_flag because we eval it in ltmain.sh.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link_static): Don't eval link_static_flag.

	* demo/dlmain.c (main): Change function prototype to be KNR
 	compatible.  From Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use no_builtin_flag.  This works around
	conflicting definitions of builtin functions with at least GCC.
	Reported by Kazuhiro Sasayama.

	* ltconfig.in (no_builtin_flag): New flag to turn off builtin
	functions when compiling an object file.
	(pipe_works): Use it.

Wed Jul 23 08:18:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (pic_flag): According to the libg++ 2.7.2 configure
 	script, DEC alpha CPUs are PIC-only, as well.  Reported by Kevin
 	Jacobs.

Mon Jul 21 09:46:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in: Replace all occurances of "sed 'X;
 	Y'" with "sed -e 'X' -e 'Y'".

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Finish full integration for `-dlopen' and
 	`-dlpreopen'.

	Fix two silly typos where I used a compile_command in place of a
	finalize_command, and vice versa.

	Change the wrapper script to check a hardcoded path only if the
	argv[0] method fails.  This is a compromise for the previous two
	patches, and should solve the majority of problems with wrapper
	scripts.  From Kenneth Albanowski.

	(link): Change a reference to hardcode_libdir_colon_separated to
	use the new hardcode_libdir_separator variable.

	* demo/Makefile.am (helldl_LDFLAGS): Add `-export-dynamic' and
	`-dlpreopen' for building helldl.

	* demo/dlmain.c (main): Succeed, even if none of the libhello
	symbols have been preloaded.

Sun Jul 20 10:17:04 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (global_symbol_pipe): Add `U' to the accepted global
 	symbol types.  This means that we will get duplicate symbols, but
 	we'll also be sure to get all global symbols used by the program.

	* ltconfig.in (pipe_works), ltmain.sh.in (link): Sort and make
	symbol output unique.

Sat Jul 19 21:54:33 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (pipe_works): Check to make sure our guessed
	global_symbol_pipe actually works.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Revert change from Kenneth Albanowski.  The
 	wrapper scripts are more reliable when they just use the argv[0]
 	value.  Generally, when the argv[0] method doesn't work, the user
 	is trying to do something weird with an uninstalled binary, and
 	should try a different approach.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (CC): Always use `$CC' instead of
 	`$cc'.  This fixes a FreeBSD bug.  Reported by Chuck Robey, and
 	others.

Mon Jul 14 22:26:15 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): In wrapper scripts, hardcode the current
 	directory to prevent phony argv[0] values from screwing up our
	program.  From Kenneth Albanowski.

Sun Jul 13 19:14:32 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Add demo/dlmain.c to the
	distribution.

Sat Jul 12 10:07:28 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am: Add helldl, made from dlmain.c, to demostrate
	`-dlopen' usage.

	* demo/dlmain.c: New file to demonstrate preloaded modules.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add `-dlopen' flag to preload dynamic
 	modules, even on static platforms.  Use `$NM' and
	`$global_symbol_cmd' to extract symbols from required files.
	(dlname): Delete dlname mode entirely.  It is rendered obsolete
	because the `.la' file format is now a public interface.

	* ltconfig.in (NM): New variable for BSD-compatible nm program.
	(global_symbol_cmd): Pipeline to extract global symbols from the
	nm output.

	* ltmain.sh.in: The .la file header should depend on `ltmain.sh',
 	not `$PROGRAM'.
	(link): Make sure $export_dynamic_flag is eval'ed before it is
 	used.

Fri Jul 11 19:33:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.spec: New Red Hat Package Manager specification file in
	order to help people prepare distributions of libtool for Linux.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Eliminate two accidental uses of the NONE magic
 	value.  These were breaking libtool's behaviour when no mode is
 	specified.

Tue Jul  8 11:01:27 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 1.0.

	* ltconfig.in: On SunOS, append /usr/etc to the PATH before
 	running ldconfig; on *BSD, append /sbin.  This was done in line
 	with the Linux change suggested by Kenneth Albanowski.

	* demo/Makefile.am (hardcode_tests): Aesthetic change to
	alphabetize order of compiling the hardcode tests.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Delete README-automake.

	* README-automake: Remove from distribution.

Wed Jul  2 19:13:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): In the executable wrapper, strip trailing
 	colons from the shlibpath_var because some ld.so's, notably
 	OpenBSD 2.0's (!), don't parse colon-terminated values correctly.
  	From Tim Pierce.

Tue Jul  1 13:03:49 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in: Eliminate uses of the NONE magic
	variable value.  Use an empty variable instead.

	* ltconfig.in (with_gcc, with_gnu_ld): Do the tests for the C
	compiler and linker if the variables are unset, or if they are not
	GNU C and ld.
	(RANLIB): Eliminate redundant `if' statement.

	* configure.in: Use AM_PROG_LD.

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PROG_LD_GNU): New macro to determine if LD is GNU
	ld.
	(AM_PROG_LD): Rename AM_PATH_PROG_LD to AM_PROG_LD.  Parameterize
	so that the user can specify `--with-gnu-ld' or `--without-gnu-ld'
	to indicate his preference.
	(AM_PROG_LIBTOOL): Use it.

Mon Jun 30 22:32:05 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Append /sbin to the path before running ldconfig on
 	Linux.  This helps superusers who haven't set their PATH
 	correctly.  Suggested by Kenneth Albanowski.

Sun Jun 29 19:51:50 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Change all the `eval "$run ..."' sequences to
 	`$run "eval ..."'.

	Change all `$ln_s ...' sequences to use `(cd /dir && $LN_S ...)'.
	This is the sequence recommended by the Autoconf manual, and
	should avoid any problems on older machines.  Eliminate all uses
	of `cp -p'.  Reported by Akim Demaille.

	(install): Use `test $# -gt 0' instead of `test -n "$1"'.

	* ltconfig.in (LN_S): Add test to see if `ln -s' works.

	* libtool.m4: Increment serial number, and require AC_PROG_LN_S.

Thu Jun 26 17:55:26 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Add missing `test' statement.  Reported by
	Akim Demaille.

Tue Jun 24 14:58:41 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): Consistently use ac_cv_path_ld instead of
	am_cv_path_ld.  From Tim Pierce.

Fri Jun 20 08:21:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Redo two robustness fixes.  Alexandre had the
 	correct approach, but I botched them.

	* ltconfig.in (dynamic_linker): Disable shared libraries on
 	MkLinux unless GNU libc is in use.  Reported by Akim Demaille.

Thu Jun 19 14:24:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Add a missing `test' command.  Reported
	by Joel Weber.
	Miscellaneous fixes to improve robustness.  From Alexandre Oliva.

Sat Jun 14 21:01:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Create invalid libtool objects when partial
	linking if we don't have PIC.  From Jeff Dairiki.
	(install): Fix bug if libtool object is installed to a file name
	without directory components.  From Jeff Dairiki.

Fri Jun 13 14:18:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo/configure): Fix up rules to run autoconf.
	(aclocal.m4): Now we depend on our own libtool.m4.

	* configure.in (AM_PATH_PROG_LD): Use it.

	* libtool.m4 (AM_PATH_PROG_LD): New macro to find the linker used
	by the C compiler.
	(AM_PROG_LIBTOOL): Use it.

	* ltmain.sh.in (install, uninstall): Support installing and
	uninstalling `.lo' files.  From Jeff Dairiki.

Wed Jun 11 11:04:59 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (ltconfig, ltmain.sh): Only move if $(srcdir) is not
	the current directory.  Don't regenerate every time the package is
	reconfigured.  Reported by Tom Tromey.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Added ltconfig, ltmain.sh, so that
	$(srcdir) is not messed with during a regular clean.

Tue Jun 10 12:26:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (ltconfig, ltmain.sh): Be sure to move these files
	into $(srcdir) once they are created.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Disable building static libraries.
	People should use their favourite AR and RANLIB commands.
	Disable building old-style objects if `--disable-static' is
	given.  Suggested by Tom Lees and Stephen Kulow.

Sun Jun  8 12:10:14 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (host_cpu, host_vendor, host_os): Patch up
 	definitions, to allow for the fact that the host_os may contain
 	hyphens (as in linux-gnu).  From Scott Goehring.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Move the `dlname' setting closer to the top
	of the file.  Suggested by David Mosberger-Tang.
	Symlink the libtool archive into the `.libs' directory so that it
	can be found by programs that want to find a library's dlname by
	searching LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Reported by David Mosberger-Tang.

Fri Jun  6 15:52:28 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Tell people to report bugs to the new libtool mailing list,
	<bug-libtool@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

Thu Jun  5 10:40:15 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (allow_undefined_flag): New variable that implements
	`-allow-undefined'.
	(archive_cmds): Enable C++ constructors for FreeBSD 2.2.  From
	David Nugent.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Accept new `-allow-undefined' flag when
 	building libtool libraries.  This tells libtool to allow
 	unresolved symbols to exist in shared libraries.  Basically, this
 	turns off shared libraries on AIX.  Suggested by Ian Lance Taylor.

Mon May 26 08:24:55 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (LD): On at least IRIX, many different flags need to
	be propagated to the linker if they are part of the compiler
	command line.  Reported by Anthony Green.

Sat May 10 12:21:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to FreeBSD 3.  From David Nugent.

Fri Apr 25 13:23:33 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Remove all traces of `-whole-archive',
	`-no-whole-archive', and libtool convenience libraries.  They were
	more trouble than they're worth.  If these are ever reimplemented,
	they need more careful attention to make portable.

	* libtool.m4, ltconfig.in: Added a `--disable-static' flag to turn
	off static library creation.  From Tom Lees (who finally convinced
	me that it was the Right Thing to do).

Tue Apr 22 12:41:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_runpath_var, runpath_var): Use them, if
	the linker has no -rpath flag.
	Quote the values we use to set runpath_var and shlibpath_var.
	(link): Use libobjlibs for libtool convenience libraries.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_runpath_var, runpath_var): Add new
	variables to describe linkers that honour `LD_RUN_PATH'.
	(host_cpu, host_os): Use these more specific variables, rather
	than the full canonical host system name.

	* ltmain.sh.in (dlname): Distinguish between missing
 	`-export-dynamic' and when the library is only statically linked.

Mon Apr 21 09:52:51 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to OpenBSD by making it an alias for
	NetBSD.  From Tim Pierce.

Wed Apr 16 19:32:05 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Temporary measures to check for a broken collect2
	program.  Right now, we just see if we're using GCC on AIX 3.

Sun Apr 13 19:40:58 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (mode): Use `egrep -e' when inferring the operation
	mode.

Sat Apr 12 13:09:24 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (linker): Some GNU ld's don't accept `--version',
	but do accept `-v'.  From Jukka Honkela.
	(ld_shlibs): AIX lossage may be settling down.  AIX 3.2.5 ld does
 	*not* hardcode direct libraries, but AIX 4.1.[45] ld does.

Mon Apr  7 09:39:02 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_action): Fix silly logic error.  From
	Bruno Haible.

Sat Apr  5 11:26:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Relink if hardcode_action is `relink',
	rather than using complex conditionals based on the other
	hardcode variables.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_action): Set to `relink', not `immediate',
 	if we can only hardcode existing directories.  Rearrange
 	conditionals to make the intent clearer, otherwise this can be one
 	hellish piece of code for the already-dizzy libtool maintainer.

Wed Apr  2 10:36:31 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* replfunc.m4: Delete from the distribution.  Documentation now
	describes how to set LTALLOCA and LTLIBOBJS in your own
	configure.in.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Make sure a libtool library only counts as
	a shared library if its library_names are non-null.
	Use timestamps for .lo's when PIC is turned off, rather than
	symlinking to the real object.  This helps invalid mixtures of PIC
	and non-PIC to fail.

Tue Apr  1 10:01:20 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute libtool.prj.

	* Shameless plug: Changed source code management system from CVS
	to PRCS.

	* libtool.scm: Initial Guile implementation of libtool.

	* ltmain.sh.in: An unexpected inconsistency in my whole approach
 	to shared libraries has proven that libtool needs to be completely
 	rewritten if I'm going to give full shared library support for
 	platforms that don't use the GNU C library version 2 (which to my
 	knowledge currently only works on GNU Hurd and Linux/GNU systems).
  	Porting the GNU C library should not be difficult, though.

	Platforms that don't have the dlopen(3) family of functions will
 	need to install GNU DLD version 4 in order to build any kind of
 	libraries at all.  Unfortunately, DLD 4 won't be released for a
 	while, because I maintain it, and I'm too busy working on libtool.

	I'll keep the old ltconfig/ltmain.sh implementation around for as
 	long as I can, and continue applying bug fixes, so that I'll have
 	a reasonable starting point for this new libtool implementation.

	It looks like this implementation will be even more complex than
 	the original (pre-0.7) libtool.  Initial estimates show that it
 	may be up to 3 times slower, and 5 times larger than libtool-0.9.
  	I'll probably have to rewrite it in Guile to get reasonable
 	performance, which will severely limit its portability for a
 	while.

	That will also introduce a bootstrapping issue, since the next
 	release of Guile will use libtool to build shared libraries.  So,
 	if users want to have shared Guile libraries, they will have to
 	configure Guile with `--disable-shared', compile it, install it,
 	then reconfigure Guile with `--enable-shared' and repeat.

	I was hoping to get libtool 1.0 out the door by early April, but
 	now it looks like it will take at least another year before it'll
 	be usable by the public at large.  April fools.  libtool.scm
	doesn't exist yet, either.

	* ltconfig.in (verify_host): Remove redundant `Transform *-*-linux*
	to *-*-linux-gnu*'.  From Bruno Haible.

Mon Mar 31 16:15:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Use the new AUTOMAKE and ACLOCAL variables.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Only fail if a convenience library doesn't
	exist, and the user specified -whole-archive.
	Fix shell quoting that was breaking @OUTPUT@ substitution.

Fri Mar 28 19:09:08 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use the hardcode_libdir_separator.
	Convenience libraries are libtool objects if we're not building
	libtool libs.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_libdir_separator): Added in case the
 	linker only honours the last of the -rpath flags (but it can
 	contain multiple colon-separated directories), such as on OSF/1.
  	Reported by Carl D. Roth.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Set the dlname if -export-dynamic is given.
	(install, uninstall): Handle the dlname file separately.

	* ltconfig.in (export_dynamic_flag): Added to allow programs to
	use reflexive dlopens.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Include the mode name in any help messages.
	(dlname): New mode to give the name to be used with dlopen(3).

	* ltconfig.in (AR): Allow AR to be set by the user, and export it
	to ltmain.sh.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Remove broken profiled library support.
	Added `-whole-archive' and `-no-whole-archive' to manipulate
	convenience libraries.

Thu Mar 27 15:55:34 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Allow the creation of static convenience
	libraries made of libtool objects.  Suggested by David
	Mosberger-Tang.

Tue Mar 25 08:38:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: On AIX, libtool also needs to look for `B' symbols
 	in nm output.  These are global variable definitions.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Linking with -static should link against the
	linklib if old_library is empty (like it is on AIX).

	* ltconfig.in: Change the order of OS detection, so that
 	linux-gnu* is detected before gnu*.

	* Makefile.am (libtool): Use the correct CC, RANLIB, LD, when
	generating libtool.  From Carl D. Roth.

	* configure.in: Find out the user-supplied CC, LD, RANLIB.  From
	Carl D. Roth.

Mon Mar 24 01:26:48 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Linking with -static should link against the old
	library, not linklib.

	* README-automake: Updated to point to Automake 1.1m.

Sat Mar 15 14:15:43 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/main.c: Use it.

	* demo/foo.h: Declare it.

	* demo/foo.c: Added definition of `nothing' so that we have an
	global variable definition, as well as functions.

Wed Mar 12 19:00:44 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Make sure either enable_shared or enable_static is
	configured.  Reported by Tom Tromey.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Bomb out if no library types are configured.

Sat Feb 22 12:47:59 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_libdir_flag_spec): Renamed
 	from `hardcode_libdir_flag'.
	(library_names_spec): Renamed from `lib_names'.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_action): Change value from
 	`rpath' to `immediate'.

	* replfunc.m4: Add AM_FUNC_ALLOCA, AM_FUNC_MEMCMP, and
 	AM_STRUCT_ST_BLOCKS.

Tue Feb 18 09:36:24 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Transform *-*-linux* to *-*-linux-gnu* to support
	old-style config.guess scripts.

Mon Feb 17 23:30:32 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Create objdir *before* linking a program into it.

Wed Feb 12 01:20:45 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Any ld --version that returns GNU is probably a GNU
	ld.  From Marcus Daniels.

	* libtool.m4: Added AM_REPLACE_FUNCS.

Tue Feb 11 01:28:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Trivial port to *-*-osf4.  From Bruno Haible.

Mon Feb 10 09:54:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: AIX 3 and 4 ld only hardcodes LIBPATH if -L is not
 	specified.  This behaviour is the same with both xlc and gcc.

Fri Feb  7 08:37:54 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* doc/platforms.texi: Yaay!  We found a workaround for HP-UX
	/bin/sh buffer overflows.  From Eric Backus.

Mon Feb  3 11:15:01 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.9.

	* PLATFORMS, doc/platforms.texi, Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am:
	Move PLATFORMS to doc/platforms.texi.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Use hardcode_libdir_flag to get a library
	directory into the resulting binary.
	Use hardcode_action, and make many simplifying changes to have
	compilation and finalization be consistent with each other.

	* ltconfig.in: Not so amazing!  It's AIX cc that hardcodes direct
	libraries... gcc doesn't, though.
	(link_rpath_flag): Change link_rpath_flag to be
	hardcode_libdir_flag.
	(hardcode_action): New variable to simplify ltmain.sh.

Wed Jan 29 12:58:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Change to take advantage of linkers that don't
	hardcode direct libraries.

	* ltconfig.in: Amazing!  AIX 3 linker doesn't hardcode direct
	libraries, which makes it less buggy than AIX 4.  Reported by Mark
	Kettenis.

	* demo/configure.in: Check for the math library.

	* demo/foo.c (foo): Change to use the `cos' function, so that we
	need to link against another library.

Tue Jan 28 20:32:19 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Export the PATH variable in order to find
	the program, rather than giving a full path.  This helps give the
	program a less confusing value for argv[0].

Sun Jan 26 15:50:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Add demo/acinclude.m4 to the
 	distribution.

Wed Jan 22 17:22:17 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtool.m4: For IRIX 6, ld needs -n32 if cc uses it.  Reported
	by Bruno Haible.

	* ltconfig.in: IRIX ld does not hardcode direct libraries.
  	Reported by Bruno Haible.

Sat Jan 18 15:15:12 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (hardcode_shlibpath_var): Allow new
	value, `unsupported', since most linkers do not allow you to use
	shlibpath_var for initial linking.

	* ltconfig.in: Lots of bug fixes from Bruno Haible.  Set wl on
	OSF/1, fix definitions of hardcode_* variables.
	(archive_cmds): Fix not to use +h on HP-UX 9.x.  Reported by Bruno
	Haible.

Fri Jan 17 09:58:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libtoolize.in: Handle explicit AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR settings.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

	* libtool.m4: Change ltconfig line to use $CONFIG_SHELL when it is
 	specified.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

Thu Jan 16 17:57:38 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo/Makefile.am (hc-direct): Do better searching for the proper
	name to do a direct link.
	(hc-libpath): Make allowances if shlibpath_var cannot be used
	to find libraries at link time, such as on AIX.

	* Makefile.am (demo_distfiles): Remove ansi2knr.1 and ansi2knr.c.

	* demo/foo.c, demo/hello.c, demo/main.c: Change ANSI prototypes to
 	KNR form, for better portability, and less ansi2knr hair.

	* demo/configure.in: Remove AM_FUNC_PROTOTYPES.

	* demo/Makefile.am: Remove ansi2knr from the AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.

	* demo/ansi2knr.1, demo/ansi2knr.c: Removed these files.

	warnings to stderr.
	(compile): Fix missing single quote.

	* ltconfig.in (hardcode_direct): On Solaris at least, using
 	DIR/libNAME.so does not hardcode DIR, so introduce a new hardcode
 	variable to reflect that.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): If linking with $link_static_flag fails,
 	then retry without it, but still use the .a versions of
 	uninstalled libtool archives.

Wed Jan 15 08:59:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Eval $link_static_flag.  Reported by Bruno
	Haible.

	(can_build_shared): Initialize at the top of the file, so that
 	shared libraries aren't built on platforms that don't support
 	them.

Sat Jan 11 13:29:08 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in, ltconfig.in, libtoolize.in, doc/libtool.texi:
 	Update the copyright completion years.

Wed Jan  8 15:01:06 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Port to IRIX 5.3, 6.2.

Mon Jan  6 08:54:00 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: HP-UX 9 support is the same as HP-UX 10, so the
	port is trivial.

	* libtoolize.in: Add --dry-run option, -n for short.

Fri Jan  3 17:26:07 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): On at least SunOS, /bin/sh doesn't
	understand "export something=val".  From Bruno Haible.

Thu Jan  2 13:04:17 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (compile): Recognize valid source file suffixes for
	Fortran and C++.

Tue Dec 17 23:17:17 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Don't allow *._o and *.l_o to be valid
 	object type suffixes, in spite of Automake's current ansi2knr
 	implementation.  Not all compilers allow non-`.o' suffixes.

Mon Dec 16 20:16:35 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Delete the `libtool' version type.

Thu Dec 12 00:04:27 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Use the full autoconf syntax when checking for GNU
	C.  Delete library stripping program, until we have a correct
	test.

Wed Dec 11 11:41:33 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: On AIX 3, use /usr/ucb/nm, not /ucb/nm.  From
	ir. M.M. Kettenis.

Mon Dec  9 12:06:31 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	Reported by Charles Kerr:
	* doc/libtool.texi (Creating Object Files): Doc fix independant ->
	independent.

	* ltconfig.in (ld_shlibs): SunOS 4 doesn't support shared library
	dependencies.

Sun Dec  8 14:39:04 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 0.7.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add README-automake to the
	distribution.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): When linking libtool libraries, use
	standard objects if they are PIC.  This prevents spurious warnings
	about invalid suffixes on AIX.

	* demo/Makefile.am: Rename libhell to libhello, so that we're not
	quite as offensive.

	* ltconfig.in: Remove unnecessary host validity checking.

	* ltmain.sh.in: Don't force people to use libNAME.la: SOMETHING.la
	is good enough (for consistency with *.a handling).

Sat Dec  7 12:31:15 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Accept files ending in .a as standard
	object files.  Reported by Ulrich Drepper.
	Remove support for creating profiled libraries (for now).
	Transform all library objects into standard objects when linking a
	program.

	* ltconfig.in (thisdir): How embarrassing!  An error in the regexp
	for finding the directory component of the script path.

Thu Dec  5 14:19:21 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (compile): Support `.S' (preprocessed assembler)
 	files.  Reported by Anthony Green.

	* libtoolize.in: Give clearer instrutions for how to update
	aclocal.m4.

	* ltconfig.in, ltmain.sh.in (link): Add support for creating
 	reloadable objects.

Wed Dec  4 00:42:53 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Fix passing -n flag to `libtool
 	--finish'.
	(compile): Compile `.lo' and `.o' objects at the same time so that
 	non-PIC objects (if they are available) can be used for linking
 	into programs and creating static archives.  Suggested by Ulrich
	Drepper.

Tue Dec  3 10:43:22 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Give the full path to the libtool library
	when sourcing it.

	* ltconfig.in (old_striplib): Do a configuration test to determine
	if old-style libraries actually can be stripped or not.

Mon Dec  2 13:57:28 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Delete reference to ABOUT-LIBS.

	* tests: Added new subdirectory.

	* doc/libtool.texi: Doc fixes, and finished up the Configuring
	chapter.

	* ltmain.sh.in (link): Allow *._o and *.l_o to be valid object
	file suffixes, for Automake's ansi2knr implementation.
	New option -version-info replaces -version-file.

	[help]: Give a pointer to mode-specific help when appropriate.

	* ltconfig.in: Changed messages to correspond to AM_PROG_CC_STDC.

	* demo: Also test Automake's ansi2knr support.

Tue Nov 19 14:09:27 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Bug fixes for AIX 4, and for static platforms.

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Fix for loops over arguments.
	Need to quote ${IFS= } -> "${IFS= }".
	(link): Fix soname_spec bug.  Create objdir whether or not we have
	shared libraries.

	* ltconfig.in: Check for library stripping program.
	Use test -f instead of test -e.

Mon Nov 18 20:10:42 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltconfig.in: Don't run the RANLIB test unless RANLIB wasn't
	set.
	Be verbose about the environment variables we were configured
	with.

	* ltmain.sh.in (objdir): change to .libs.

Sat Nov 16 12:02:03 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in (install): Just plunge ahead with the
	installation... don't try to enforce dependencies.

Fri Nov 15 17:57:36 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh.in: Fix up $libdir to be $dest in install mode.

Sun Nov 10 13:08:04 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* ltmain.sh: Finished rewrite of compile, link, and install
	modes.

	* New ChangeLog file for libtool-0.7, since I've totally rewritten
	libtool.

Fri Mar 15 14:21:15 1996  Gord Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* For historical reasons: this is when I started writing libtool.
