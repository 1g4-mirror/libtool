	* tests/sh.test: After `set dummy [...]', check for `shift'
	within the same and following line.
	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_enable_tag, func_mode_install)

	m4/ltsugar.m4, m4/ltversion.m4, m4/lt~obsolete.m4: RMS says,
	'I think the [license of autoconf macro files] should be:

	# with or without modifications, as long as this notice is

	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_extract_archives)
	(func_extract_an_archive): On darwin, uniq can not take the flags
	-cd together, thanks to Ralf for the fix, also ar does not accept
	N, so we use the fact that ar x libfoo.a foo.o will always extract
	the first foo.o in the archive and we then delete foo.o from the
	archive, which will also delete only the first foo.o, then rinse
	and repeat.
