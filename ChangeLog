	* config/ltmain.m4sh (func_extract_archives)
	(func_extract_an_archive): On darwin, uniq can not take the flags
	-cd together, thanks to Ralf for the fix, also ar does not accept
	N, so we use the fact that ar x libfoo.a foo.o will always extract
	the first foo.o in the archive and we then delete foo.o from the
	archive, which will also delete only the first foo.o, then rinse
	and repeat.
