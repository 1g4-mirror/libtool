	* doc/libtool.texi:

	Moved "LTCC" in "--add-tag" example before "CC" because users may
	inadvertently do something like the following:

		CC=$CXX LTCC=$CC ./ltconfig --add-tag=...

	Doing the above would set LTCC to the C++ compiler ($CXX), which
	is incorrect since LTCC should be the C compiler.  Also added
	documentation explaining this potential problem.

	* Makefile.am:

	Added ltcf-c.sh, ltcf-cxx.sh and ChangeLog.1 to list of files to
	include in the distribution.

	Added ltcf-sh.sh and ltcf-cxx.sh to the list of data files.

	* libtool.m4:

	Change name of macro that enables C++ support in libtool from
	"AC_LIBTOOL_CPP" to "AC_LIBTOOL_CXX."  "CPP" is typically
	associated with preprocessors, whereas CXX is associated with C++
	compilers.

	Moved LTCC before CC in call to ltconfig to make sure LTCC is not
	set to the compiler pointed to by CC after CC has been reset to
	another compiler.

	Call ltconfig with ${CONFIG_SHELL-/bin/sh} just like we do in
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.

	Save value of $CC and $CFLAGS before resetting them for use with
	configuration tags.

	* libtoolize.in:

	Added ltcf-c.sh to list of files related to "libtoolization."
	Until we decide if other compiler/language libtool configuation
	scripts should also be included in the file list, leave out
	ltcf-cxx.sh for now.

	* ltcf-cxx.sh:

	Disable shared library support for currently unconfigured
	platforms.

	Updated IRIX, Linux and Solaris link characteristics.  They now
	match more with their C compiler counterparts.

	* ltconfig.in:

	Corrected tag name variable in "END LIBTOOL TAG CONFIG: $tagname"
	text.

	* Makefile.am:
	* libtool.m4:
	* ltconfig.in:
	* ltmain.in:
	* doc/libtool.texi
	* tests/defs:

	The beginnings of multi-compiler/language support in libtool.

	Integrated Alexandre's configuration tags patch, part of Thomas'
	patch and part of my patch.

	These patches make it possible for libtool to support
	compilers besides C compilers.  This also includes support for
	linkers besides `ld', and similarly for other tools commonly used
	for development.  See the libtool documentation for more details.

	Moved all C compiler related configuration code to `ltcf-c.sh',
	described below.

	Multi-compiler/language still isn't complete but testing is now
	possible.

	* ltcf-c.sh:

	Added this file.  It contains all of the C compiler related
	configuration code that was previously in ltconfig.in.  This
	script is meant to be sourced by the ltconfig script alone.  It is
	not meant for use by the user.  Eventually, the contents of this
	file will be moved to `libtool.m4'.

	* ltcf-cxx.sh:

	Added this file.  It contains C++ compiler related configuration
	code (e.g. C++ compiler as linker, etc).  It is meant to be used
	when creating configuration tags using the newly added "--add-tag"
	ltconfig option.  See the libtool documentation for more details.
	Eventually, the contents of this file will be moved to
	`libtool.m4'.

	This script also includes support for extracting the objects and
	libraries the compiler would use when linking a C++ binary.  This
	support should allow static constructors and the like to work
	properly.

Continued in ChangeLog.1
