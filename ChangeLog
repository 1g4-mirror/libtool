1999-03-19  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* tests/noinst-link.test: new test
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): added noinst-link.test
	* doc/libtool.texi: document it

1999-03-19  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* ltmain.in (dependency_libs): There is no reason to infer that
	the pseudo library is invalid if dependency_libs='' at
	install-time, or else libltdl/libltdl.la is invalid!!

1999-03-18  Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* merged my inter-library dependencies code from the ILD branch:
	* NEWS: inter-library dependencies are now supported
	* configure.in: add the depdemo subdirectory
	* depdemo/*: new demo to demonstrate inter-library dependencies
	* tests/depdemo*: new tests for depdemo
	* ltconfig.in: added hardcode_into_libs (whether library paths
	  should be hardcoded into the libraries),
	  it currently defaults to 'no'
	* ltmain.in: new internal 'relink' mode to relink libraries
	  on platforms with hardcode_into_libs=yes, save command line
	  arguments in libtool_args, accept relative -L directories,
	  ignore -lm on BeOS and Cygwin, always ignore -lc,
	  handle -l, -L and .la arguments later, always make the library
	  installation directory (-rpath) absolute, in relink mode don't 
	  delete the not-relinked library and exit immediately after relinking,
	  try to find already-installed libtool libraries that were specified
	  using -l, support hardcoding of library paths into libraries too,
	  export shlibpath before linking libraries, and a lot of other
	  big changes that I don't want to describe here... please read
	  the source.
	  
	* merged Gary's Win32 code from the ILD branch:
	* NEWS: Win32 DLLs are now supported
	* TODO: removed .a library namespace clash for win32.  It is
	  now resolved.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, library_names_spec):  removed $libname.a.
	  Creating a dll with libtool no longer creates an import library.
	* ltconfig.in (extract_expsyms_cmds): Create $objdir if it does
	  not exist -- i.e. we need to generate import an import library
	  in a directory which has no libs of its own.
	* doc/libtool.texi (old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds,
	  extract_expsyms_cmds): documented these new variables.
	* ltconfig.in (extract_expsyms_cmds): New variable.  Commands to
	  extract the exported symbol list from a dll.
	  (old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds): New variable.  Commands to build
	  an old archive from the extracted expsyms list.
	* ltmain.in: run the cmds in extract_expsyms_cmds and
	  old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds as necessary.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, old_archive_from_new_cmds): no longer
	  required.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, shlibpath_overrides_runpath): I'm not even
	  sure whether win32 honours the runpath at all when searching for
	  a dll to load!  Anyway, when set to yes this prevents a gratuitous
	  warning.
	* ltmain.in (deplib): The cygwin environment doesn't actually have
	  -lm, and although the linker fakes having one, specifiying it to
	  libtool will break ILD, so we ignore it when generating
	  dependencies.

	* doc/PLATFORMS: Thanks to Alexandres changes below, both my
	hp boxes pass the entire test suite.

1999-03-17  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (hpux*, hardcode_minus_L): should be no, we have +b
	(hpux*, hardcode_libdir_separator): set to colon

1999-03-17  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* doc/PLATFORMS: egcs is gcc; updates from Erez Zadok

1999-03-16  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltmain.in (deplibs, beos*): don't append -lc
	Reported by Xavier Pianet <xavier@xingo.com>

	* tests/build-relink.test (hardcode_action): when set to relink,
	skip the test with lt-hell

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add mkstamp
	Reported by Xavier Pianet <xavier@xingo.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add ChangeLog.0

1999-03-16  Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* doc/libtool.texi: some minor corrections to the "-dlopen self"
	  documentation
	* tests/Makefile.am: sorted by name, added assign.test
	* ChangeLog: started new file

	* ltconfig.in: some cosmetical changes
	* ltmain.in: ditto

Continued in ChangeLog.0
