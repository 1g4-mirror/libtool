	* libtool.m4 (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): Use pass_all for
	mips-*-linux* and mipsel-*-linux*.

2001-06-24  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SETUP): Remove failed try to
	transform linux to linux-gnu in $host.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER): Match $host_os against
	linux*, not linux-gnu*.
	(AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): Likewise.

2001-06-24  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_PATH_SEPARATOR):  Set
	PATH_SEPARATOR appropriately if it is not set already,
	(_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Use it.
	(AC_ENABLE_SHARED): Ditto.
	(AC_ENABLE_STATIC): Ditto.
	(AC_ENABLE_FAST_INSTALL): Ditto.
	(AC_PATH_TOOL_PREFIX): Ditto.
	(AC_PATH_MAGIC): Ditto.
	(AC_PATH_PROG_NM): Ditto.

	From Tim Van Holder  <tim.van.holder@pandora.be>:
	* libtool.m4: Use the canonical absolute path test
	([\\/]* | ?:[\\/]) and $PATH_SEPARATOR wherever
	appropriate.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_PIC): Properly recognize DJGPP as a
	platform that doesn't support shared libraries.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): Avoid this test on DJGPP; use a
	fixed value (12K) instead.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_GLOBAL_SYMBOL_PIPE): Don't forget $ac_exeext
	when testing for link success.

	* configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Bumped version to 1.4a.

	Complete the new configure time tags creation facility based on
	the ltcf-*.sh and ltconfig.in files from multi-language-branch:
	* libtool.m4:  More refactoring and reformatting.
	(_LT_AC_LANG_GCJ_CONFIG): Merged ltcf-gcj.sh from
	multi-language-branch.
	(_LT_AC_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): Merged ltcf-cxx.sh from
	multi-language-branch.
	* configure.in (AC_PROG_CXX, LT_AC_PROG_GCJ): Compiler checks must
	be done before AC_PROG_LIBTOOL which appends tags based on their
	results.

2001-06-12  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* docs/libtool.texi: Updated the libltdl interface documentation
	to bring it up to date.

2001-06-06  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* demo/Makefile.am (objdir): Use `libtool --config' for
	extracting configuration values, since a given value may
	be present in each tag.
	(hc-libpath): Ditto.
	(hc-minusL): Ditto.
	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Add tagged configurations from
	the --with-tags option.
	(_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK): Factored out into separate configuration
	macros -- The interdependencies and running order are still
	immutable, and need a lot of work to fix.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG): Taken from the previous incarnation of
	_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK -- this macro is used both to create the
	primary (C language) libtool configuration from
	_LT_AC_LTCONFIG_HACK and also to append tagged configurations from
	_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG.
	* NEWS:  Merged from multi-language-branch.
