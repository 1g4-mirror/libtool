2002-11-08  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* doc/libtool.texi: Add --mode=* to every example using libtool.

2002-11-03  Ossama Othman  <ossama@doc.ece.uci.edu>

	* ltmain.in: add support for installing into temporary
	staging area (e.g. 'make install DESTDIR=...')

2002-11-03  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): restore setting
	allow_undefined_flag=unsupported for cygwin and mingw.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): ditto, for both "normal" gcc/ld
	and for the (unmaintained?) MSVC case.

2002-11-03  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* doc/libtool.texi (Install mode): document new
	-inst-prefix option.

2002-11-02  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Print a warning if the mode is not specified.
	* doc/libtool.texi: Document the change that the mode must be
	specified.

2002-10-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): use printf, not
	echo. (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): use new shell function
	win32_libid on w32 platforms
	* ltmain.in: add new section for shell functions. Add
	win32_libid() shell function.
	* f77demo/Makefile.am: add -no-undefined flag

2002-10-30  Rob Browning  <rlb@defaultvalue.org>

	* ltdl.c (realloc): Remove custom realloc. (#define
	rpl_realloc realloc) and comment out later code for custom
	realloc. You can't define your own malloc unless you know
	enough about the malloc in use to be able to tell how big
	the src ptr is. The disabled code incorrectly used the
	*destination* ptr to decide how much to copy. This
	sometimes results in out-of-bound accesses which cause
	segfaults. This is a quick hack for now; we may want
	something cleaner later. (tryall_dlopen_module): check to
	be sure (dirname_len > 0) before testing first character
	against '/'. (try_dlopen): check for feof(file) in read
	loop -- otherwise infloop?

2002-10-25  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (-XCClinker): New flag passes a linking option
	directly to the compiler driver without appending ${wl}.

2002-10-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* README-alpha: Add some release not templates for inspiration and
	consistency at release time.

	* Makefile.am (cvs-diff): Compress the generated diff file, ready
	for upload to ftp.gnu.org.

2002-10-25  Howard Chu  <hyc@highlandsun.com>

	* ltmain.in [aix]: Be sure to deal with xlc_r, cc_r and other
	compiler variants.

2002-10-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_FILE_IMPGEN_C): Removed.  No longer used.
	(_LT_AC_FILE_LTDLL_C): Ditto.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CONFIG) [cygwin, mingw, pw32, os2]: Don't call
	_LT_AC_FILE_LTDLL_C or _LT_AC_FILE_IMPGEN_C.

2002-10-25  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: When LDFLAGS="-Wl,-brtl,[other options]", the
	-brtl special-case code for AIX never gets triggered because
	were are being too specific about how we search for -brtl.
	Use case statement to avoid this. Remove extraneous
	semicolon.
	* ltmain.in: Recognize the IBM xlc compiler.

2002-10-24  Andrew Suffield  <asuffield@debian.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (lt_dlopenext): Corrected sense of "file not
        found" check.

2002-10-24  Ossama Othman  <ossama@doc.ece.uci.edu>

	* ltmain.in: Support compiler names matching g++*

2002-10-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * libtool.m4: Removed old Windows cruft.
        * libtool.m4: Adapted pw32 to be like Cygwin/MinGW.

2002-10-23  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	ltmain.in: Do not add 1 to the version under IRIX, it is
	not necessary.

2002-10-15  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

        * libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): avoid long delay on 
         cygwin/Win9x when computing commandline length.
        (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER): fix postinstall_cmds when
        sources are in a subdirectory
        * ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYSSEARCHPATH): use $PATH_SEPARATOR, not
        $ac_path_separator
        * configure.ac: move depdemo-specific stuff.  You must configure
        libtool before you can try './libtool --features'.
        * mdemo-inst.test: set $PATH to include the directory in which
        the modules are installed (on cygwin, DLL search path is the
        $PATH)

2002-10-15  Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * ltmain.in: MinGW works identically to Cygwin.

        * libtool.m4: lt_cv_sys_max_cmd_len hard-coded to 8192
        *  Model MinGW configuration after Cygwin configuration.
           Some portions share implementation.

2002-10-11  Elizabeth Barham <soggytrousers@yahoo.com>

        * libtool.m4: Pattern MinGW library naming after that
        used by Cygwin except use 'lib' prefix rather than 'cyg'.
        * Transfer some configuration from Cygwin with adjustments
          for MinGW.

2002-10-15  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

        * libtool.m4: When a module is built for AIX, the 'lib'
        prefix isn't needed, neither is the version. AIX dlopen
        will honor the RPATH in a library.

2002-10-11  Christoph Egger  <Christoph_Egger@gmx.de>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS, darwin): Add
	-install_name to the link line only when -dynamiclib is
	specified for a module.  Use -bind_at_load when linking C++
	shared libraries.

2002-10-04  Elizabeth Barham  <soggytrousers@yahoo.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SETUP): GCC now checks -shared to
	create a dll for Windows targets.

2002-09-24  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Fixed a few spelling errors.

2002-09-17  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Commented out access() call that checks for a
	library file's existence and permissions, as it appears to fail
	in every case.

2002-09-09  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: Custom $symcode for Tru64 UNIX to catch 'Q',
	read-only constants.

2002-09-09  Rainer Orth  <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.de>

	* libtool.m4 (osf[345]): Append $major to soname_spec.
	Reflect this in library_names_spec.
	* ltmain.in (osf): Prefix $major with '.' for use as extension.

2002-08-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * ltdl.m4 & libltdl/ltdl.c: Port fully to native Win32 API.

2002-07-31  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* f77demo/.cvsignore: New file, forgotten in the last commit.

2002-07-31  Eric Lindahl  <erik@theophys.kth.se>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_PROG_LIBTOOL): Added support for the new F77
	Fortran support tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O, _LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Support F77 tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_F77, _LT_AC_LANG_F77, AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_F77_CONFIG):
	New macros for F77 tag Fortran support.
	* configure.ac: Add support for creating the new F77 tag.
	* bootstrap: Add f77demo directory to the list to be processed.
	* Makefile.am: Add support for FFLAGS and FLIBS.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Add new Fortran tests.
	* tests/f77demo-*.test: New files.
	* f77demo/configure.ac, f77demo/cprogram.c, f77demo/fooc.c 
	* f77demo/foof.f, f77demo/foo.h, f77demo/fprogram.f 
	* f77demo/Makefile.am, f77demo/README: New files.

2002-07-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (tryall_dlopen): We need to catch missing file
	errors early so that file_not_found() can detect what happened.

2002-06-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfreisen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER) [mingw]: Remove
	extraneous '=' character which appears in gcc 3.1
	-print-search-dirs output.
	Handle both upper and lower case drive letters when testing for
	Windows vs POSIX style path output from -print-search-dirs
	output.

2002-06-24  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in (Piecewise linking): Add a clause to skip creating
	the export file until the reloadable object file(s) have been
	created, then use them as input for $export_symbols_cmds.

2002-06-23  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYS_DLOPEN_DEPLIBS): Need to quote [ and ] for
	Autoconf.

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_SYS_DLOPEN_DEPLIBS): HP/UX needs
	libltdl_cv_sys_dlopen_deplibs set to yes.

2002-06-23  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SETUP, _LT_AC_LOCK): Use
	AC_PROVIDE_IFELSE to test AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL and
	AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN, necessary for autoconf 2.53.

2002-06-23  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (argz_insert): Actually, BEFORE can be NULL
	when *PARGZ_LEN is non-NULL, so the assertion to the contrary was
	bogus.
	Reported by Bob Friesenhahn <bfreisen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	and Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>

2002-06-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (foreach_dirinpath): Ensure that filename is '\0'
	terminated by all code paths.
	Reported by Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-06-20  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	From Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>:
	* doc/libtool.texi (Platform quirks): s/dependan/dependen/
	* libtool.m4 (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): Ditto.
	* TODO: Ditto.

2002-06-13  Rainer Orth  <ro@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>

	* ltmain.in (irix, nonstopux): Set major before use.

2002-06-11  Daniel Kobras  <kobras@linux.de>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (try_dlopen): Don't return bogus handle to user
	  if tryall_dlopen() fails.

2002-06-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* tests/pdemo-exec.test: Typo.  s/hell-static/hell_static/

2002-05-31  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* NEWS: Updated.
	* libtool.m4: use $NM to create the symbol list on cygwin, not
	$ltdll_cmds as on mingw.  For all tags, (and host=cygwin) set
	allow_undefined_flag="" so that the --auto-import magic
	works properly.  For all tags (and host=cygiwn) set
	always_export_symbols=no -- it is unnecessary thanks to
	binutils' auto-export magic.
	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Don't force cygwin to use the LoadLibrary
	wrapper; use cygwin's builtin implementatino of dl*.
	* cdemo/Makefile.am: the downside of unsetting
	'allow_undefined_flag' -- we must include -no-undefined
	in the _la_LDFLAGS variable.
	* depdemo/l1/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l2/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l3/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* depdemo/l4/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* mdemo/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* tagdemo/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* demo/Makefile.am: ditto.  But also, we must make special
	provision to clean up the hell0 wrapper script.
	* pdemo/Makefile.am: ditto -no-undefined.  ditto hell0.
	And use 'hell_static' instead of 'hell.static'.
	* tests/pdemo-inst.test: use 'hell_static' instead
	of 'hell.static'.
	* tests/pdemo-exec.test: ditto.

2002-05-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* tests/build-relink2.test: look for installed libl3.la
	in $prefix/lib/ as well as $prefix/lib/extra/.

2002-05-30  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* tests/hardcode.test: Use libtool --config to collect the
	variable values for the test, otherwise the tag values interfere
	with a straight grep.

2002-05-30  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Finally fix the annoying bug which always adds all tags to the
	libtool script built by your project configure.  Now we set the
	default tags depending on whether AC_PROG_CXX et. al. are actually
	called from configure.ac.

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Don't default the tagnames when
	no --with-tags argument is given.
	(_LT_AC_SHELL_INIT): Factored out from the AC_DIVERT_PUSH code
	in...
	(_LT_AC_PROG_ECHO_BACKSLASH): ...which now calls the macro
	instead.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_CXX): Use _LT_AC_SHELL_INIT to add CXX to the
	initialisation sequence for tagnames.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_GCJ): Similarly for GCJ tag.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_RC): Likewise for RC tag.

2002-05-21  Jon Meredith  <jonm@alchemetrics.co.uk>

	* ltmain.in: Fix a problem on SCO OpenServer5 that caused a
	failure in three depdemo-make tests. For some reason the linker
	tries to find the dependent libraries using the library search
	path before it has read the libraries specified with absolute
	paths in the full commandline. This patch add -L's for each of
	the dependent library directories so that they can be resolved.

2002-05-09  Nick Hudson  <skrll@netbsd.org>

	* libtool.m4: Update support for NetBSD
	* ltdl.m4: Make sure that libltdl_cv_func_dlopen and
	libltdl_cv_lib_dl_dlopen are set and used instead of the
	ac_cv_ versions. Also, use lt_cv_sys_global_symbol_pipe
	instread of global_symbol_pipe. This fixes the detection of
	dlopen on BSD derived plaforms and more importantly fixes
	need_uscore detection.

2002-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): head -1 -> sed 1q to
	port to POSIX 1003.1-2001 hosts, like textutils 2.0.21 with
	_POSIX2_VERSION=200112.

2002-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* ltmain.in: Don't assume that "sort +2" works, as POSIX
	1003.1-2001 says that "sort +2" is supposed to sort the file
	named "+2".  An example host that behaves like this is
	textutils 2.0.21 with _POSIX2_VERSION=200112.

2002-05-06  Loren James Rittle  <rittle@latour.rsch.comm.mot.com>

	* ltmain.in: Detect and handle object name conflicts while
	piecewise linking a static library.

2002-05-02  Dave Vasilevsky  <thevas@mac.com>

	* ltmain.in: Remove convenience libraries from deplibs for Darwin.

2002-05-02  Fritz Elfert  <felfert@to.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): Modify archive_expsym_cmds
	to catch properly handle dll alias symbols.

2002-04-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): Use $build_os not $host_os.

2002-04-14  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* doc/libtool.texi (C++ libraries): Finally updated to reflect
	Libtool's support for C++.

2002-04-14  Jean-Frederic Clere  <jfrederic.clere@fujitsu-siemens.com>

	* libtool.m4: Update support for Fujistu-Siemens Computers (FSC).
	* ltmain.in: Add support for EBCDIC based systems.

2002-04-07  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (LT_AC_PROG_SED): Refactor, removing temporary directory
	and consistent use of the shell variable namespace "lt_ac_".

2002-04-02  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Finish the tag matching logic started yesterday and
	refactor it a bit.

2002-04-01  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in: Handle the case when no tag is explicitly set, and
	$base_compile has a space in front of $CC, and revert the setting
	of tagname checked in on 2002-3-14.

2002-04-01  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	* tagdemo/foo.cpp: Use C++ IO to catch problems linking to C++
	runtime libraries.
	* tagdemo/main.cpp: Ditto.

2002-03-16  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* TODO: Removed obsolete comments about RMS' package system.

2002-03-14  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@gnu.org>

	ltmain.in: Touch-up to make testsuite pass, and default tagname
	to CC when it isn't explicitly set.

2002-03-14  Anthony Green  <green@redhat.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_CC_C_O): Albert Chin's gcj fix.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_COMPILER_PIC): Per Bothner's change for not
	using -DPIC with gcj.

2002-03-11  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* ltmain.in(compile): bring a touch of order to the option processing

2002-02-09  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Updated.
	* THANKS: Added Rob Collins and Chuck Wilson for their cygwin
	work.

	From Robert Collins  <robert.collins@itdomain.com.au>:
	* configure.ac (AC_EXEEXT): Needed for DOSish systems.
	* libtool.m4 (shlibpath_overrides_runpath) [cygwin]: Set to yes
	when compiling with gcc.
	(lt_prog_compiler_pic) [cygwin]: No longer needs the -DDLL_EXPORT
	hack, so we just say the pic is the default.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS) [cygwin]: Extract symbols from a
	library normally.
	[cygwin]: Declare C++ compiler characterisics for g++, taking into
	account the new auto-import support in cygwin ld.

	eliminating duplicate -lgcc's from the link line.
	[cygwin]: Be smarter about .exe suffixes.
	* demo/configure.ac (AC_EXEEXT, AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL):  Support
	DOSish systems properly.
	* depdemo/configure.ac (AC_EXEEXT, AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL):  Ditto.
	* demo/Makefile.am (deplibs-check): Allow for .exe suffix.  Use
	hell_static instead of hell.static for multi-`.' inhibited OSes.
	* tests/demo-exec.test: Ditto.
	* tests/demo-inst.test: Ditto.
	* demo/foo.h [cygwin]: Sanitize cygwin dll support.
	* demo/foo.c (_LIBFOO_COMPILATION_): No longer required.
	* demo/hello.c (_LIBFOO_COMPILATION_): Ditto.
	* depdemo/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Use depdemo_static instead
	of depdemo.static for multi-`.' inhibited OSes.

	* tests/depdemo-inst.test: Ditto.
	* mdemo/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS):  Ditto for mdemo.static.
	* tests/dryrun.test: Ditto.
	* tests/mdemo-exec.test: Ditto.
	* tests/mdemo-inst.test: Ditto.
	* tests/build-relink.test:  Be careful about possible .exe
	suffixes.
	* tests/noinst-link.test: Allow for .exe suffix.

2002-02-07  Alexandre Oliva  <aoliva@redhat.com>

	Reverted incorrect patch:
	2001-10-24  H.J. Lu  <hjl@gnu.org>
	* ltmain.sh: Allow link against an archive when building a
	shared library.
	* libtool.m4 (lt_cv_deplibs_check_method): Always use
	file_magic for Linux ELF.

2002-01-30  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* libtool.m4 (LT_AC_PROG_SED): Removed a mysterious newline.

2002-01-28  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* libtool.m4 (LT_AC_PROG_SED): New macro tests sed for truncation of
	output.  AC_REQUIRE the new macro.
	* ltmain.in: Use $SED rather than plan old sed, as set by the new
	macro LT_AC_PROG_SED.

2002-01-10  Volker Christian  <voc@soft.uni-linz.ac.at>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (find_handle_callback): treat the result of a call
	to access(2) correctly when deciding whether a library can be found
	in a directory from user_search_path.

2002-01-07  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* NEWS: Fixed wrong path for texinfo.tex.
	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 1.4e.

	GNU libtool 1.4d was released.

	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 1.4d.
	* NEWS: updated.
	* config.guess, config.sub, texinfo.tex:  Synchronised from
	ftp.gnu.org.

2001-12-06  Jens Petersen  <petersen@redhat.com>

	* ltmain.in: Replace all test "-a"s by "&& test"
	for portability.

2001-11-28  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): Change the
	factor of saftey as 3/4 of the result was not low enough.

2001-11-28  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtoolize.in: The test for whether AC_PROG_LIBTOOL is defined
	in aclocal.m4 had bitrotted slightly.
	Reported by Takahiko Kawasaki <Takahiko_Kawasaki@cii.csk.co.jp>

2001-11-27  Donald D. Anderson  <dda@sleepycat.com>

	* ltmain.in: Treat freebsd like openbsd, in that -lc/-lc_r should
	not be explicitly used.  ld handles this depending on the presence
	of the -pthread option.

2001-11-27  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	With help from Michael Matz <matz@kde.org>:
	* ltmain.in:  Add a new command line argument
	--preserve-dup-deps for preserving duplicate
	dependent libraries.
	* libtool.texi: Document it.

2001-11-27  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_MAX_CMD_LEN): Send "test"
	warnings to /dev/null, helps FreeBSD and maybe others.

2001-11-15  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: quote LTCC because autoconf AC_PROG_CC_STDC
	macro might add to $CC if options needed by compiler to
	grok ANSI.

2001-11-15  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	From Joseph S. Myers  <jsm28@cam.ac.uk>:
	* ltmain.in: Typo.

2001-11-15   Mo DeJong  <supermo@bayarea.net>

	* ltmain.in: Place parens around a generated relink_command
	so it is run is a subshell. This avoids an install error
	where libtool ended up in the wrong directory after
	relinking a .la file.

2001-10-31  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.ac (pkgdatadir): Move the invocation of AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE

	$version_type == nonstopux.

2001-10-28  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (foreach_dirinpath): change some types to size_t
	from int because strlen() returns size_t. argz_len changed to
	size_t because argzize_path() takes 3rd argument as size_t, not
	int.
	Based on lint run from Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

2001-10-27  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_TAGCONFIG): Cray sed does not allow character
	sets to contain the separator character.
	Reported by Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_WITH_LTDL): New macro to add `--with-included-ltdl'
	option to configure, but to find an appropriate ltdl library and
	append the right options to link it.

2001-10-24  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS): Remove a stray ' quote.

	backwards compatibility.
	(AC_LIBLTDL_INSTALLABLE): Ditto.
	* doc/libtool.texi (Distributing libltdl):  Adjust documentation.

2001-09-22  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_DLLIB): Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00
	support shl_load *and* dlopen, dlopen works correctly only
	with a patch. Because we want to avoid the situation where we
	build on a system with the patch but deploy on a system without,
	use shl_load exclusively if found.

2001-09-22  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (_LT_AC_FILE_LTDLL_C): Be carefule that the start

	(_LT_AC_FILE_IMPGEN_C): Ditto.
	Reported by Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>

2001-09-22  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libtool.m4 [mingw* cygwin*]: Small improvement for mingw-hosted
	tool support (while still running libtool on cygwin). In that case
	PATH_SEPARATOR is ':', but gcc -print-search-dirs still prints its
	search path with ';' as separator.
	(AC_LIBTOOL_RC, AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_RC_CONFIG): Add support for .rc
	files (Windows resource files), compiled by the resource compiler
	(windres in mingw) to .o files.
	(AC_PROG_NM): Minor bug fix for $PATH elements with spaces in
	them.
	* configure.ac: Use LT_AC_PROG_RC.
	* ltmain.in: Check for .rc files.
	* NEWS: Updated.

	* ltmain.in: Add a space to $base_compile in the case statement,
	as the case labels checks for trailing spaces, but there aren't
	necessarily in $base_compile.

2001-09-22  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: When setting archive_cmds for CC, don't

2001-09-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	From Tor Lillqvist <tml@iki.fi>:
	* ltmain.in [cygwin* mingw*]: Take care of the difference between
	wrapper script name and executable name.

	* libtool.m4 (archive_cmds) [darwin1.[0-2]]: Darwin uses zsh-3.1.6
	for /bin/sh, and that shell does not handle escaped quotes
	properly yet.
	Reported by Christopher Pfisterer <cp@chrisp.de>

2001-09-21  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c: Match function return type with prototype

	from HP-UX cc.

2001-09-21  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	memory bugs as a result.

2001-09-21  Albert Chin  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* libtool.m4: Don't include main() when testing for command to
	parse $NM output because some C++ compilers don't allow you to
	take the address of main (e.g. HP-UX aCC).

	* libtool.m4: Some uses of $GXX were unquoted, but GXX is either
	NULL or yes.  Use "$GXX".

2001-09-13  Assar Westerlund  <assar@sics.se>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_LTDL_DLLIB): call dlopen with arguments so the test
	does not fail due to a prototype in dlfcn.h

2001-09-13  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* ltdl.m4 (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for assert.h.

	* bootstrap: Be robust to having no files that need removing.

	* libltdl/configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Bump libltdl version to

	version info to 4:0:1.

2001-09-11  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4: No need to undefine([symbols]), proper quotation is
	enough.

2001-09-10  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4: CVS Autoconf guarantees a decent default IFS, so
	there is no need for us to preset it anymore.
	Be careful not to set IFS="${IFS}$PATH_SEPARATOR" for PATH
	splitting, otherwise spaces in directory names will be lost.
	Use $PATH_SEPARATOR... don't rely on $ac_path_separator, which was
	an autoconf internal until just now, when it disappeared!
	* ltmain.in: Default IFS once, at the start.
	Reported by Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr>

2001-09-10   Brad  <brad@comstyle.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_DEPLIBS_CHECK_METHOD): Missed an instance of

2001-09-06  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS) [solaris*]: Typo. s/GXX/GCC/.

	* libtool.m4 (archive_cmds, archive_expsym_cmds) [solaris*]: Changing
	no_undefined_flag from `-z text' to `-z defs' (see entry below at
	2001-04-11  Alexandre Oliva  <aoliva@redhat.com>) has a problem.
	when linking a shared library with gcc calling /usr/ccs/bin/ld (eg.
	the gcc supplied with Solaris 8 companion CD), using the flag
	-no-undefined, shared library linking will always fail because of
	the unresolved symbols from libgcc.a.  Consequently we have to
	provide a path to libgcc.a when linking shared libraries in
	conjunction with -no-undefined!

	From Michael Pruett <mpruett@engr.sgi.com>:
	* libltdl/ltdl.c (find_module): `0' valued arguments to
	tryall_dlopen_module() must be explicitly cast to avoid compiler
	warnings on some environments.

	From Daniel Johnson <danielj7@mac.com>:
	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS) [darwin*]: Move from GNU
	ld section to non-GNU ld section.

2001-09-05  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* pdemo/Makefile.am (helldl):  Automake 1.4 can't find the target
	if we use helldl$(EXEEXT), and Automake 1.5 barfs unless we do.
	Using both targets to the left of the colon seems to work though!

2001-09-03  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	DLD.

	"LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH".
	(LTDL_ARCHIVE_EXT): Macro to prevent hardcoding ".la".
	(archive_ext): Have only one copy of ".la" in the readonly
	segment of the compiled library.
	(find_handle_callback): Don't bother trying to dlopen the file if
	it doesn't exist.
	(find_handle): Don't bother searching for files if no search_path
	was supplied.
	(file_not_found): A new function to determine whether the last
	error was due to a file not found condition.
	(try_dlopen): Renamed from lt_dlopen() and changed to have the
	same footprint as tryall_dlopen.  This involved a minor rewrite of
	much of the internals of this function.
	(lt_dlopen): A new function wrapped arounf try_dlopen().
	(lt_dlopenext): If a file already has a suitable extension, don't
	bother adding additional extensions and trying to open those.
	Tidy up the rest of the code to prevent continued searching with
	an eventual FILE_NOT_FOUND when a genuine failure earlier in the
	search process could be legitimately reported.

	* demo/Makefile.am (helldl$(EXEEXT)): Automake-1.5 made me change
	this from just `helldl'.

2001-07-31  Robert Boehne  <rboehne@ricardo-us.com>

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_PROG_LD_SHLIBS) Fixed a problem

	* libtool.m4 (AC_LIBTOOL_LANG_CXX_CONFIG): Corrected and improved

	  non-existent `ltcf-cxx.sh' file.

	* doc/libtool.texi (LTDL_SET_PRELOADED_SYMBOLS): Removed
	  parentheses at end of starting "defmac" line, as pointed out by

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (N_ELEMENTS):  Deleted.  How come nobody noticed
	there was no way this could have ever worked?
	(lt_dlcaller_set_data): Now that valid caller_ids must be
	non-zero, allocate an addition entry in the caller_data vector and

2001-08-14  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (lt_dlcaller_register): Caller ids are allocated

	to indicate that libltdl has not yet initialised.

	* ltmain.in (exec_cmd): Fix quoting in execute mode so that the
	double quotes added by libtool (to prevent lossage with embedded
	spaces in filenames etc.) are not interpreted as literals by the
	shell.

2001-08-13  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>
