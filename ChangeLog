1999-04-04  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in: if ld_shlibs=no, set can_build_shared=no too,
	otherwise it will just be disregarded.  This would cause
	netbsd/m68k with GNU ld a.out, and certainly many other platforms, 
	to incorrectly believe that shared libraries were supported, while 
	archive_cmds was empty, causing shared libraries not to be created

1999-04-03  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* NEWS: improved support for AIX and HP/UX

1999-04-03 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* NEWS: updated
	* libtool.m4: check for main in libm instead of cos
	* ltmain.in: cosmetic fixes, don't try to link libraries only once
	  (although it's not necessary on many platforms and looks ugly...),

1999-04-02  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltmain.in (convenience): fixed race condition when more than one 
	library was linked with the same convenience library by
	uniquifying the extract directory.  It is now named after the new
	library *and* the old one, and lives in the objdir of the new one.

1999-04-02  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltmain.in (-L*): do not abort just because a directory specified 
	with -L does not exist; just warn and discard it

	* depdemo/l1/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): no-dependencies
	* depdemo/l2/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): ditto
	* depdemo/l3/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): ditto
	* depdemo/l4/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): ditto

	* ltconfig.in (archive_cmds, sunos4*): where we used -Bstatic, we
	should have been using -Bshareable

	* demo/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): clean EXTRA_* from deplibs-check

	* libtool.m4 (LDFLAGS, LIBS): pass them to ltconfig, for the tests 
	that involve linking
	* Makefile.am (LDFLAGS, LIBS, libtool, clibtool): ditto
	* tests/Makefile.am (CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS): set
	(LDFLAGS, LIBS, TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): pass them down

1999-04-02  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.columbia.edu>

	* doc/PLATFORMS: 1.2f ok on various versions of hpux cc

1999-04-02  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (link_all_deplibs): set to unknown by default
	* ltmain.in: test != no, not = yes
	* doc/libtool.texi: document unknown

1999-04-01 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* doc/libtool.texi: documented deplibs.test

	* demo/Makefile.am: moved testsuite specific declarations to the end,
	  the deplibs check is now optional
	* libltdl/configure.in: read libtool --config only once,
	  merged AC_SYS_SYMBOL_UNDERSCORE+AC_SYS_NM_PARSE from libtool.m4
	* libtool.m4: AC_SYS_SYMBOL_UNDERSCORE+AC_SYS_NM_PARSE were not
	  used, lt_dlopen and silent may be empty, AC_SYS_LIBTOOL_CYGWIN
	  no longer necessary
	* ltconfig.in: NM is already checked in libtool.m4,
	* ltmain.in: always link all static dependency_libs
	* tests/Makefile.am: added deplibs.test
	* tests/demo-exec.test, demo-inst.test: removed hell0
	* tests/deplibs.test: new test to test the deplibs_check_method

1999-03-31 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* ltmain.in: always link a library before its dependency libs
	* mdemo/Makefile.am: test -export-symbols-regex
	
1999-03-30 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* doc/libtool.texi: fixed a typo
	* libtoolize.in: add the libtool scripts to libltdl.tar.gz
	* libtool.m4: don't AC_SUBST(USE_SYMBOL_UNDERSCORE),
	  AC_CHECK_LIBM sets LIBM, AC_LIBLTDL_INSTALLABLE doesn't work
	  when libltdl is already installed
	* *demo/Makefile.am: use LIBM
	* *demo/configure.in: AC_SUBST LIBM
	* libltdl/configure.in: use ac_cv_sys_symbol_underscore instead of
	  USE_SYMBOL_UNDERSCORE
	* ltconfig.in: added link_all_deplibs variable
	* doc/libtool.texi: document it
	* ltmain.in: always search for libname.la - don't eval libname_spec,
	  when linking libraries against static ones just print a warning
	  and add them to dependency_libs, add -lc before deplibs,
	  always link all dependencies of a static library or if
	  link_all_deplibs is yes, hardcode library paths if
	  hardcode_into_libs is no, don't link against dependency_libs 
	  that already are deplibs

1999-03-30  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (aix4*, collect2name): make sure collect2 exists
	before running string on it, to avoid errors on old gccs
	Reported by Erez Zadok <ezk@cs.columbia.edu>

	* ltconfig.in (aix4*, hardcode_libdir_flag_spec): unless we're
	using gcc with old collect2, use -b libpath to hardcode the
	library search path

	* ltmain.in, ltconfig.in: reverted most of the quoting changes
	from 1999-03-25; Gary's delay_variable_subst patch from 1999-02-19 
	obviates it.  Keep only quoting of $PATH, for uniformity with
	other systems that already did it

1999-03-29  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	* libltdl/ltdl.c (lt_dladdsearchdir): Forgot to mallocate the
	extra byte of memory for the teminating NUL, and forgot to
	strcpy the original path in to the new memory before appending
	the new path compononent.
	
1999-03-27 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* NEWS: updated
	* README: updated (BeOS support, no longer shared libraries
	  support for AmigaOS), cleanups, we have now two mailing lists
	* REAMDE-alpha: autogen -> bootstrap, we have now two mailing lists
	* THANKS: added Xavier Pianet
	* doc/PLATFORMS: BeOS works
	* doc/libtool.texi: we have now to two mailing lists,
	  updated -dlopen self documentation, documented libltdl's license,
	  put each author in a separate line,
	  inter-library dependencies on uninstalled libtool libraries are
	  now supported, cleanups and minor corrections
	* libltdl/COPYING.LIB: new file
	* libltdl/ltdl.[ch]: added special exception to the LGPL license
	* libtool.spec: removed, it was outdated
	* Makefile.am: removed libtool.spec
	* ltmain.in: use TMPDIR when possible, create a subdirectory
	  in the temporary directory, added -export-symbols-regex to the help,

1999-03-25  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* demo/Makefile.am: create a static library, link two libtool
	archives with it, then link the program hell0 with both
	* demo/hell1.c, demo/hell2.c: dummy files used to create the
	libtool archives without introducing symbol conflicts
	* tests/demo-exec.test, tests/demo-inst.test: run the new program
	* ltconfig.in (irix5*, irix6*, deplibs_check_method): pass_all

	* ltmain.in ($PATH): instead of modifying the PATH, better prevent 
	its expansion the first time *_cmds variables are eval'ed.  Modify 
	$show within loops that eval them so as to expand variables
	* ltconfig.in (*_cmds): quote $ so that they're not expanded by
	the first eval

1999-03-25  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* ltmain.in ($PATH):  Expand any tildes in the users path to the
	contents of $HOME to avoid problems with *_cmds splitting and
	evaluation.
	
1999-03-24 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* TODO: support -dlopen for libraries
	* doc/PLATFORMS: Erez Zadok reported that libtool works on bsdi 4.0.1
	* doc/libtool.texi (libltdl): libltdl supports BeOS
	* libltdl/ltdl.c: shlib_ext was declared even if LTDL_SHLIB_EXT
	  didn't exist, partially reverted my previous patch: BeOS will
	  automatically search in ADDON_PATH
	* ltmain.in: don't allow relative run-paths, fixed a typo in a warning,
	  ignore -dlopen self for libraries and objects,
	  only accept -L paths that exist, minor cleanups,
	  bugfix: add -lc for normal libraries, not convenicence libraries
	  removed offensive warnings/comments

1999-03-24  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (ld_shlibs, amigaos*): disable shared libraries

1999-03-23  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* libltdl/configure.in: the sed expression for finding the shared
	library extension used to think the . in [.] for the cygwin
	shared_library_names_spec was the start of the extension!!  We now
	remove anything in square brackets (assuming that the square
	brackets delimit a sed or expr expression which is not part of the
	extension) before looking for the extension.

	* TODO (cygwin):  food for thought re: mutually dependant dlls.

1999-03-21  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* tests/build-relink.test: if we relink and have hardcode_direct, 
	removing an uninstalled library breaks an uninstalled program

	* doc/libtool.texi: documented convenience libraries
	* TODO: removed entry about it

	* tests/*-unst.test: if directory is not configured, skip it
	* tests/demo.test, tests/mdemo.test: unused, removed
	* tests/depdemo.test: ditto

1999-03-20 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* doc/libtool.texi (link mode): documentation for -module updated
	* ltconfig.in: fast-install mode doesn't work for
	  hardcode_into_libs=yes
	* ltmain.in: bugfix: "-dlopen self [-all]-static" wouldn't use
	  dlopen_self_static, automatically enable -export-dynamic when
	  using "-dlopen self",	always make run-paths absolute,
	  ignore -lc only on platforms that don't have such a library,
	  cleanups in the ILD code, find even installed libtool libraries
	  that were moved, before generating the DLL-import library we need
	  to set libname, improved hardcoding of shlibpath for libraries,
	  don't generate an installable pseudo-library for convenience
	  libraries, bugfix: export_symbols would be removed immediately
	  before it is used

1999-03-19 Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* use the same header in all configure.in's and Makefile.am's
	* NEWS: improved support for BeOS and Cygwin
	* TODO: ILD branch was merged, all internal variables and macros
	  are now documented
	* demo/Makefile.am: use $(LIBS) instead of -lm
	* doc/libtool.texi: documented new variable hardcode_into_libs
	  and thread_safe_flag_spec, renamed all AM_ENABLE/DISABLE_* macros
	  to AC_*, documented AC_DISABLE_FAST_INSTALL and AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN
	* libltdl/ltdl.c: added two new error messages (cannot_open_error,
	  cannot_close_error), use them where approriate,
	  BeOS support (thanks to Xavier Pianet), on BeOS search modules
	  additionally in ADDON_PATH
	* libtool.m4: rewrote AC_CHECK_LIBM: BeOS and Cygwin don't have
	  libm and *-ncr-sysv4.3* requires libmw
	* ltconfig.in: don't check for LoadLibrary, hardcode dlopen
	  configuration for BeOS and Cygwin
	* ltmain.in: fix sourcing of .la files on Solaris 
	  (patch by Raja R Harinath)

1999-03-19  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (sunos4*, with_gnu_ld, hardcode_minus_L): remove,	we
	have -rpath
	(aix4*, without_gnu_ld, hardcode_shlibpath_var): unsupported is
	default
	(hpux9*, hpux10*, hpux11*, archive_cmds): drop +s, unneeded here
	(hpux9*, hpux10*, hpux11*, hardcode_libdir_flag_spec): add +s
	before +b
	(hpux9*, hpux10*, hpux11*, shlibpath_overrides_runpath): since +s
	appears before +b, set it to yes
	(hardcode_shlibpath_var, hardcode_action): do not use
	shlibpath_var to specify the compile-time search path; it loses,
	and we may end up linking with pre-installed older versions of
	libraries instead of yet-to-be-installed ones
	(*, hardcode_direct, hardcode_minus_L): remove entries that set
	them to no, that is default

	* demo/Makefile.am (hc-direct, hc-libpath, hc-minusL): link with
	$$hardcode_libdir_flag_spec, if available, with libdir=$(libdir),
	to make sure the hardcode_* variables will produce the expected
	results even in the presence of a hardcoding flag; depend on
	libhello.la having been installed already
	(hc-libflag): link with the installed library, but try to
	hard-code the uninstalled one
	* doc/libtool.texi: document the changes

	* tests/*.test: when a test fails, skip tests that depend on it.
	If a certain configuration is not supported, skip all its tests.

	* doc/libtool.texi: reorder tests to reflect execution order

	* tests/noinst-link.test: new test
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): added noinst-link.test
	* doc/libtool.texi: document it

1999-03-19  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* ltmain.in (dependency_libs): There is no reason to infer that
	the pseudo library is invalid if dependency_libs='' at
	install-time, or else libltdl/libltdl.la is invalid!!

1999-03-18  Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* merged my inter-library dependencies code from the ILD branch:
	* NEWS: inter-library dependencies are now supported
	* configure.in: add the depdemo subdirectory
	* depdemo/*: new demo to demonstrate inter-library dependencies
	* tests/depdemo*: new tests for depdemo
	* ltconfig.in: added hardcode_into_libs (whether library paths
	  should be hardcoded into the libraries),
	  it currently defaults to 'no'
	* ltmain.in: new internal 'relink' mode to relink libraries
	  on platforms with hardcode_into_libs=yes, save command line
	  arguments in libtool_args, accept relative -L directories,
	  ignore -lm on BeOS and Cygwin, always ignore -lc,
	  handle -l, -L and .la arguments later, always make the library
	  installation directory (-rpath) absolute, in relink mode don't 
	  delete the not-relinked library and exit immediately after relinking,
	  try to find already-installed libtool libraries that were specified
	  using -l, support hardcoding of library paths into libraries too,
	  export shlibpath before linking libraries, and a lot of other
	  big changes that I don't want to describe here... please read
	  the source.
	  
	* merged Gary's Win32 code from the ILD branch:
	* NEWS: Win32 DLLs are now supported
	* TODO: removed .a library namespace clash for win32.  It is
	  now resolved.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, library_names_spec):  removed $libname.a.
	  Creating a dll with libtool no longer creates an import library.
	* ltconfig.in (extract_expsyms_cmds): Create $objdir if it does
	  not exist -- i.e. we need to generate import an import library
	  in a directory which has no libs of its own.
	* doc/libtool.texi (old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds,
	  extract_expsyms_cmds): documented these new variables.
	* ltconfig.in (extract_expsyms_cmds): New variable.  Commands to
	  extract the exported symbol list from a dll.
	  (old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds): New variable.  Commands to build
	  an old archive from the extracted expsyms list.
	* ltmain.in: run the cmds in extract_expsyms_cmds and
	  old_archive_from_expsyms_cmds as necessary.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, old_archive_from_new_cmds): no longer
	  required.
	* ltconfig.in (cygwin, shlibpath_overrides_runpath): I'm not even
	  sure whether win32 honours the runpath at all when searching for
	  a dll to load!  Anyway, when set to yes this prevents a gratuitous
	  warning.
	* ltmain.in (deplib): The cygwin environment doesn't actually have
	  -lm, and although the linker fakes having one, specifiying it to
	  libtool will break ILD, so we ignore it when generating
	  dependencies.
	  
1999-03-17  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* doc/PLATFORMS: Thanks to Alexandres changes below, both my
	hp boxes pass the entire test suite.

1999-03-17  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltconfig.in (hpux*, hardcode_minus_L): should be no, we have +b
	(hpux*, hardcode_libdir_separator): set to colon

1999-03-17  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* doc/PLATFORMS: egcs is gcc; updates from Erez Zadok

1999-03-16  Alexandre Oliva  <oliva@dcc.unicamp.br>

	* ltmain.in (deplibs, beos*): don't append -lc
	Reported by Xavier Pianet <xavier@xingo.com>

	* tests/build-relink.test (hardcode_action): when set to relink,
	skip the test with lt-hell

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add mkstamp
	Reported by Xavier Pianet <xavier@xingo.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add ChangeLog.0

1999-03-16  Thomas Tanner  <tanner@gmx.de>

	* doc/libtool.texi: some minor corrections to the "-dlopen self"
	  documentation
	* tests/Makefile.am: sorted by name, added assign.test
	* ChangeLog: started new file

	* ltconfig.in: some cosmetical changes
	* ltmain.in: ditto

Continued in ChangeLog.0
