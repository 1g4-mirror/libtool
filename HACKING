GNU Libtool
***********

1. Introduction
===============

This file attempts to describe the processes we use to maintain libtool,
and is not part of a release distribution.

2. Maintenance Notes
====================

* If you incorporate a change from somebody on the net:
  If it is a large change, you must make sure they have signed the
  appropriate paperwork, and be sure to add their name and email
  address to THANKS

* If a change fixes a test, mention the test in the ChangeLog entry.

* If somebody reports a new bug, mention his name in the ChangeLog entry
  and in the test case you write.

* The correct response to most actual bugs is to write a new test case
  which demonstrates the bug.  Then fix the bug, re-run the test suite,
  and check everything in.

* Some files in the libtool package are not owned by libtool.  These
  files should never be edited here.  These files are:
	COPYING
	INSTALL
	config/
	    + config.guess
	    + config.sub
	    + depcomp
	    + install-sh
	    + mdate-sh
	    + missing
	    + texinfo.tex
	doc/
	    + fdl.texi
	libltdl/
	    + COPYING.LESSER
	    + config.guess
	    + config.sub
	    + install-sh
	    + missing
  The ones that are important for a release can be udated with,
  `make -fMakefile.maint fetch'.

* Changes other than bug fixes must be mentioned in NEWS


2. Test Suite
=============

* Use "make check" liberally, on as many platforms as you can.  Use as
  many compilers and linkers you can.


3. Naming
=========

* We've adopted the convention that exported Autoconf macros should be
  named with a leading `LT_' and be documented in the libtool manual.
  Internal macros begin with `_LT_' if they are visible to aclocal, or
  potentially part of an AC_DEFUN/AC_REQUIRE path, or else `_lt_' if
  they are very low level.  This convention was only introduced just
  before libtool-2.0, so there may still be exceptions in the existing
  code.  But all new code should use it.

* All shell variables used internally by libtool's Autoconf macros
  should be named with the a leading `lt_' (not that they cannot clash
  with the `_lt_' macro namespace).


4. Editing `.am' Files
======================

* Always use $(...) and not ${...}

* Use `:', not `true'.  Use `exit 1', not `false'.

* Use `##' comments liberally.  Comment anything even remotely unusual.

* Never use basename or dirname.  Instead use sed.

* Do not use `cd' within back-quotes, use `$(am__cd)' instead.
  Otherwise the directory name may be printed, depending on CDPATH.

* In general, if a loop is required, it should be silent.  Then the body
  of the loop itself should print each "important" command it runs.


5. Editing libtoolize.in and ltmain.in
======================================

* Use shell functions, but be careful not to assume local scope for
  variable names.  Don't use `return', instead echo the result of a
  function and call it from within backquotes.

6. Release Procedure
====================

* If you are a libtool maintainer, but have not yet registered your
  gpg public key and (preferred) email address with the FSF, send an
  email, preferably GPG-signed, to <ftp-upload@gnu.org> that includes
  the following:

    (a) name of package(s) that you are the maintainer for, and your
        preferred email address.

    (b) an ASCII armored copy of your GnuPG key, as an attachment.
	("gpg --export -a YOUR_KEY_ID > mykey.asc" should give you
	this.)

  When you have received acknowledgement of your message, the proper GPG
  keys will be registered on ftp-upload.gnu.org and only then will you be
  authorized to upload files to the FSF ftp machines.

* Make sure you have a copy of xdelta installed, and a copy of the previous
  release tarball in the build directory.

* Update the version number in configure.ac.
  See http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/contribute.html for details of
  the numbering scheme.

* Update NEWS, ChangeLog.

* Make sure the 'Be Bourne compatible' shell snippet near the top of
  ./libtoolize.in, ./ltmain.in matches the latest autoconf wisdom by
  updating to match CVS autoconf AS_SHELL_SANITIZE in autoconf's
  lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4.

* Run ./bootstrap.

* Have some tea.  If you are running on less than 3.6GHz CPU, order
  a pizza too ;-)

* Run ./configure and then make.

* Run `make -fMakefile.maint fetch', which will fetch new versions of the
  files that are maintained outside of libtool.

* Run ./commit.

* Run `make -fMakefile.maint cvs-dist' which will build a release tarball
  (with `make distcheck'), tag the tree with release-$(VERSION) and generate
  the gpg signature files.

* Run 'make -fMakefile.maint deltas' (pass LASTRELEASE=min.maj[.mic[alpha]]
  if needed) to create both diff and xdelta files between the previous
  release tarball and the new with detached gpg signature files and clear
  signed directive files.

* Upload release tarball, diff file and xdelta file, plus their associated
  detached gpg signature files and clear signed directive files to
  ftp-upload.gnu.org.  If the upload is destined for ftp.gnu.org, then the
  files should be placed in the /incoming/ftp directory.  If the upload is
  an alpha release destined for alpha.gnu.org, then the files should be
  placed in the /incoming/alpha directory.

* Send announcement to libtool@gnu.org and autotools-announce@gnu.org,
  if not an alpha send to info-gnu@gnu.org as well.

* Update version number in configure.ac to next alpha number.
  See http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/contribute.html for details of
  the numbering scheme.

* Update NEWS, ChangeLog.

* Run ./commit.

* Update the webpages, libtool.html will need to indicate the latest
  release number and the news page should get a HTMLified copy of your
  release announcement.

* If not an alpha, replace manual.html with the new one
  (generate with `make -f Makefile.maint web-manual').



7. Alpha release note template
==============================

To: libtool@gnu.org, autotools-announce@gnu.org
Subject: GNU Libtool @VERSION@ released (alpha release).

The Libtool Team is pleased to announce alpha release @VERSION@ of GNU
Libtool.

GNU Libtool hides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a
consistent, portable interface. GNU Libtool ships with GNU libltdl,
which hides the complexity of loading dynamic runtime libraries
(modules) behind a consistent, portable interface.

Here are the compressed sources:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@VERSION@.tar.gz
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@VERSION@.tar.bz2

Here are the xdeltas and diffs against libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.diff.gz
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.xdelta

Here are the gpg detached signatures:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@VERSION@.tar.gz.sig
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@VERSION@.tar.bz2.sig
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.diff.gz.sig
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.xdelta.sig

Here are the MD5 and SHA1 checksums:

  @MD5SUM@ libtool-@VERSION@.tar.gz
  @MD5SUM@ libtool-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
  @MD5SUM@ libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.diff.gz

  @SHA1SUM@ libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.diff.gz
  @SHA1SUM@ libtool-@PREV_RELEASE_VERSION_ON_THIS_BRANCH@-@VERSION@.xdelta

This release has @SUMMARY_OF_IMPROVEMENTS_SINCE_LAST_RELEASE_ON_THIS_BRANCH@.

This release was bootstrapped with @BOOTSTRAP_TOOLS_WITH_VERSIONS@,
but is useable with @COMPATIBLE_AUTOTOOL_VERSIONS@ in your own
projects.

Alternatively, you can fetch the unbootstrapped sourcecode from
anonymous cvs by using the following commands:

  $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
  $ cvs -z3 -d :ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/libtool \
  co -r @CVS_RELEASE_TAG@ libtool

You will then need to have recent (possibly as yet unreleased) versions
of Automake and Autoconf installed to bootstrap the checked out
sources yourself.

New in @VERSION@: @RELEASE_DATE@

  @EXCERPT_FROM_NEWS_FILE@

Please report bugs to <bug-libtool@gnu.org>, along with the verbose
output of any failed test groups, and the output from `./libtool --help.'
