This is GNU modular hell, an example package that uses GNU libtool with an
Automake-generated environment to build two simple libraries and programs.

It demonstrates how to build both dynamic and static libraries
that can be dlopened. You'll need a wrapper (libltdl)
for your dlopen functions. For static libraries we prefix all
non-static symbols with libname___ using the LTEXP(symbol) macro.
When dlopening these static libraries, we cut the prefix off to
get the real name.
