	* demo-conf.test, demo-inst.test, demo-make.test, demo-unst.test,
	hardcode.test: Use $make instead of make.

	* defs (make): Add definition of $make that uses the $MAKE
	environment variable, if set.  Suggested by Bruno Haible.

	* demo-unst.test (leftovers): Change the find command to ignore
	files beginning with a dot, as egrep -v doesn't seem to do the
	trick.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* hardcode.test: Added a test to make sure that libtool's idea of
	hardcoding system linkers is correct.

	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Remove all files that the tests
	may have created.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* For all tests, discover srcdir when running from the command
	line.

	* demo-unst.test: Don't fail if make uninstall doesn't delete
 	files beginning with a dot, since spurious .nfsXXX files may be
 	present when running NFS.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* suffix.test: New test to guarantee that libtool compile
 	recognizes valid source file suffixes.

	* demo.test: Break up into demo-conf.test, demo-make.test,
	demo-exec.test, demo-inst.test, and demo-unst.test, so that passes
	and failures are reported more quickly.

	* link-2.test: Test to make sure that .lo files don't get built
	directly into programs.

Sat Dec  7 15:44:49 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tlibtool: A typically-configured libtool script, that uses
	../ltmain.sh.in for its backend.

	* link.test: Make sure that it is legal to link against .a files.

Mon Dec  2 16:31:10 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo.test: Try compiling the ../demo subdirectory, with no
	special options.

	* test-e.test: Check that we haven't used `test -e' anywhere in
	our portable shell scripts.
