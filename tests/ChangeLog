	* hardcode.test: AIX 3 doesn't have strings(1) so we need to do a
	funny tr and pipe the output to fgrep.  From Bruno Haible.

Mon Feb  3 15:17:18 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Do the full make sequence with
	--disable-shared, then without.

	* demo-sttc.test: Configure the demo directory with
	--disable-shared.

Wed Jan 29 14:02:03 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Rewrite to use fgrep on output from ``strings
 	-a'' if using fgrep directly on the binary files fails.  From Mark
 	Kettenis.

Tue Jan 28 14:00:23 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Make sure that ../demo/libhello.la really is a
	shared library before running hardcoding tests.

Sat Jan 18 10:33:21 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-conf.test: Use the CONFIG_SHELL environment variable when
 	running configure in the demo directory.  From Bruno Haible.

	* Makefile.am (clean-local): Make distclean in the demo directory,
	so that ``make clean; env CC=cc make check'' works as one would
	expect.

	* demo-make.test: Fix typo (use $make instead of make).  Reported
 	by Akim Demaille.

Thu Jan 16 21:43:18 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tlibtool: Rewrote to grab all the settings from the generated
	libtool script.

	* hardcode.test: Make allowances if shlibpath_var cannot be used
	to find libraries at link time, such as on AIX.

Tue Jan 14 09:17:27 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo-conf.test, demo-inst.test, demo-unst.test, hardcode.test:
 	Use $make instead of make.

	* defs (make): Add definition of $make that uses the $MAKE
	environment variable, if set.  Suggested by Bruno Haible.

	* demo-unst.test (leftovers): Change the find command to ignore
	files beginning with a dot, as egrep -v doesn't seem to do the
	trick.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

Mon Jan 13 14:01:17 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* hardcode.test: Added a test to make sure that libtool's idea of
	hardcoding system linkers is correct.

Fri Jan  3 23:15:22 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Remove all files that the tests
	may have created.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* For all tests, discover srcdir when running from the command
	line.

	* demo-unst.test: Don't fail if make uninstall doesn't delete
 	files beginning with a dot, since spurious .nfsXXX files may be
 	present when running NFS.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

Thu Jan  2 13:03:41 1997  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* suffix.test: New test to guarantee that libtool compile
 	recognizes valid source file suffixes.

Sun Dec  8 14:43:15 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo.test: Break up into demo-conf.test, demo-make.test,
	demo-exec.test, demo-inst.test, and demo-unst.test, so that passes
	and failures are reported more quickly.

	* link-2.test: Test to make sure that .lo files don't get built
	directly into programs.

Sat Dec  7 15:44:49 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tlibtool: A typically-configured libtool script, that uses
	../ltmain.sh.in for its backend.

	* link.test: Make sure that it is legal to link against .a files.

Mon Dec  2 16:31:10 1996  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* demo.test: Try compiling the ../demo subdirectory, with no
	special options.

	* test-e.test: Check that we haven't used `test -e' anywhere in
	our portable shell scripts.
